Word embedding methodologies can improve the performance of machine prediction algorithms that use text-data inputs by serving as a form of dimensionality reduction (a type of information compression). These methodologies can also be used to identify semantic meanings of words. For example, Google\\xe2\\x80\\x99s word2vec algorithm, which was trained on a dataset of 1.6 billion words, could discern that \\xe2\\x80\\x9cman\\xe2\\x80\\x9d minus \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwoman\\xe2\\x80\\x9d plus \\xe2\\x80\\x9cqueen\\xe2\\x80\\x9d was approximately equal to \\xe2\\x80\\x9cking.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nIn a recent paper, Kartchner et al. introduced code2vec, which is an application of word-embedding methodology to medical diagnosis codes. In this methodology, the set of diagnoses noted in an individual\\xe2\\x80\\x99s claims over a fixed time period are treated as words in a single document. The aim is to use \\xe2\\x80\\x9cdocuments\\xe2\\x80\\x9d created from a large population to identify clinically meaningful relationships between diagnoses. \\n\\nIn this initiative, we aimed to explore the application of word-embedding methodology to:\\n\\nMedical diagnosis and procedure codes extracted from the insurance claims of several insurance payer populations\\n\\nMedical research publications obtained from PubMed \\n\\nOur primary goals were to:\\n\\nConfirm that word-embedding methodology can extract clinically interesting relationships between medical conditions and procedures\\n\\nCompare and contrast the discovered relationships of data from Medicare and commercially insured populations.\\n\\nDevelop hypotheses about the utility of word embedding methodology to support the development of machine learning tools such as disease prediction and cost prediction \\n\\nIdentify a methodology to query research papers covering topics similar to a given paper, using relationships discovered by a word embedding methodology\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nData \\n\\nSources\\n\\nThis analysis primarily focused on three distinct datasets. We created two datasets of medical diagnosis and procedure codes. These datasets were derived from the insurance claim data on two populations: a commercial (employer-sponsored) insurance pool, and a Medicare Advantage (retiree) population, both administered by UnitedHealthcare insurance company. The primary difference between these two populations from a healthcare perspective is demographic: commercial insurance tends to cover people ages 0 to 64 who are employed, while Medicare Advantage covers retirees age 65 and older (with some exceptions for special circumstances). However, medical coding and billing practices may differ between the two populations as well; for example, as a government-funded program, Medicare Advantage has specific documentation requirements and tends to have lower price variation for services than commercial insurance. \\n\\nThe third dataset used in this analysis is a corpus of medical research papers extracted from the PubMed archive. The primary purpose for pursuing this dataset is a desire to identify related concepts in the research literature and, perhaps, a tool for quickly identifying papers covering a topic similar to a given article (i.e., a document query tool). This may be useful to Savvysherpa in identifying potential avenues of innovation based on knowledge from academic and clinical research. \\n\\nWe provide specific details on each dataset below. \\n\\nCommercial\\n\\nFor the commercial population, the data consisted of diagnosis and procedure code sequences from fully insured commercial members who were continuously enrolled for the entire time period between 2002 and 2016. Diagnosis codes followed the International Classification of Diseases (ICD) manual, versions 9 and 10 (ICD-9 and ICD-10, respectively). Procedure or service codes followed the Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) manual. In total, there were 49,191 unique diagnosis and procedure codes from 80,265 individuals.\\n\\nMedicare Advantage\\n\\nThe data consisted of diagnosis and procedure code sequences from Medicare Advantage members who were continuously enrolled between 2006 and 2016. In total, there were 42,234 unique diagnosis and procedure codes from 57, 898 members.\\n\\nMedical Publications\\n\\nWe used two corpora to create word vectors: PubMed and the PubMed Central Open Access subset (PMC). PMC is a digital archive of biomedical and life-science literature, which contains more than 1 million full-text open access articles. In total, we processed 1,300,186 text-file versions of research articles.\\n\\nPre-Processing\\n\\nClaims Data\\n\\nThe claims data was prepared using a combination of Spark cloud-computing framework and Hive data warehouse. We also used the Microsoft SQL server to store the data. We created a customized spark kernel to easily shift between using Spark/Hive and Python/MS SQL.\\n\\nThe following is the complete data-extraction phase for both commercial and Medicare datasets:\\n\\nAll diagnosis and procedure codes from fully insured, continuously enrolled members were extracted from MiniOV and MiniHPDM.\\n\\nUnique diagnosis and procedure codes were listed per member per day.\\n\\nA chronological list of diagnosis and procedure codes per member per year month was processed. Year-months with no claims were filled with dummy variables.\\n\\nA chronological list was produced of each member\\xe2\\x80\\x99s diagnosis and procedure codes for all available years. Unknown and blank diagnosis/procedure codes were not normalized.\\n\\nMedical Publications\\n\\nPublications needed to be in a text file format for word embedding. PMC articles were already available in a text format; however, PubMed articles were distributed as XML files and needed to be converted to a text format. All PubMed XML articles were placed in the Hadoop distributed file system (HDFS) found in Savvysherpa Hadoop cluster, and Spark was used to load the xml data. We extracted titles and abstracts using PySpark PubMed parser library and dumped them into one large text file, which was more than a gigabyte in size. \\n\\n\\n\\nOnly minimal pre-processing was done so as to retain stop words that could help with finding candidate phrases during word embedding. On the paper by Agarwal et al, stop-word removal was shown to reduce classification performance on papers for bioinformatics, which include PubMed research literature. In addition, it was found out that having stop words could speed up training because you spend less time dealing with stop words that have little impact on the model. However, we did remove the following from the text:\\n\\nCitations.\\n\\nParenthetical text. In the biomedical texts, it has been shown that many words or phrasal lexical entries contain parentheses, hyphens, etc., which can cause problems in natural language processing. For example, in biomedical texts, units of measurement are often written inside parenthesis\\xe2\\x80\\x94e.g., \\xe2\\x80\\x9c(BMI, in kg/m2).\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Hence, we decided to remove any text inside parenthesis. Punctuation was also removed.\\n\\nSection titles. When inspecting a smaller dataset, we found that retaining section titles affected the quality of the word embedding. This was primarily because most section titles are found in the references section, which shouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t be part of the corpus.\\n\\nAfter pre-processing, we preformed sentence splitting and tokenization. Sentence splitting was required so that each instance fed into the embedding model was a sentence. Tokenization was required to preserve multiword tokens, which meant that we have to include phrase candidates from tokenized sequences.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMethodology\\n\\nClaims-Data Word Embeddings\\n\\nWe processed the claims datasets separately from one another. Following the paper of Kartchner et al., we built the word embedding datasets by fitting global vector (GloVe) algorithms to our corpus of medical codes. This method involves the construction of a word co-occurrence matrix whose (i,j)-th entry is the count of times that code i is noted on the same person as code j. \\n\\nWe also explored the construction of embedding models wherein the co-occurrence matrix used approximated time-distance weights; that is, varying the definition of \\xe2\\x80\\x9cco-occurrence\\xe2\\x80\\x9d as a function of how far apart in time the two codes were noted on an individual\\xe2\\x80\\x99s stream of medical claims. For the Medicare population, we estimated the average number of codes submitted per month to be 14. \\n\\nThe GloVe algorithm is framed as a least-squares optimization problem that attempts to learn word vectors (the embeddings), which live in a D-dimensional Euclidean space and represent the relative position of codes compared to the entire code dictionary, and where these relative positions are such that the objective function is maximized. We used a stochastic gradient descent algorithm implemented in \\xe2\\x80\\xa6 to perform this optimization. \\n\\nAs a final step, we used k-means clustering applied to the resulting word vectors to group related codes or words from each corpus. Loosely speaking, this procedure identifies groups of words or codes that ought to have contextually similar meaning; for example, two diagnosis codes falling in the same cluster may indicate similar underlying disease or common comorbidity. In implementing this clustering method, one needs to determine the number of clusters to impose. We determined the optimal number of clusters using a graphical method known as elbow k-means clustering. Using elbow k-means, we obtained clusters of codes that can be further broken down into sub-clusters. In a second application of k-means clustering, we found that using existing clinical classification software groupings (obtained from AHRQ) as initial clusters produced better results as determined by visual inspection and further investigation.\\n\\nComparing Word Embeddings for Commercial and Medicare Data\\n\\nOne of the research questions from this initiative required the comparison of code embeddings between commercial and Medicare Advantage populations. However, directly comparing independently generated embeddings from two separate corpora is not possible. To address this, we used Procrustes alignment to project the embedding matrices of the commercial and Medicare data onto one another. This allowed us to directly compare the embeddings for these datasets and quantify their differences.\\n\\nPredictive Modeling\\n\\nFor the purposes of insurance risk adjustment, the medical diagnoses of a population can be used to build predictive models for total healthcare expenditure. However, most existing methods for this task do not use the full sequence of medical codes over a period of time; rather, they apply clinically-defined groupings of codes to generate indicator variables that are then fed into a linear regression model for costs. We attempted to use our sequences of medical codes to predict total allowed amount for fully insured, continuously enrolled commercial members. We fit the data to supervised latent Dirichlet allocation (sLDA), which attempts to identify underlying topics in a document and predict responses to the presence of those topics. In this case, the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cdocument\\xe2\\x80\\x9d is the medical code sequence of each member for each year, and the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cresponse\\xe2\\x80\\x9d is the total allowed amount of a given member in a specific year.\\n\\nWe trained the model on data from 2002 to 2014, where the response variable was total healthcare cost in 2015. We looked at results from a test dataset (which included only medical codes already seen by the model) and a holdout dataset (which included some medical codes that hadn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t been seen by the model).\\n\\nMedical Publication Word Embeddings\\n\\nFor this dataset, we used phrase-detection algorithms to identify combinations of words that were frequently used together. There were two phrase detection algorithms used in the study: tri-gram and RAKE (Rapid Automatic Keyword Extraction Algorithm). After counting phrase candidates across all documents, we computed a minimum frequency at which they must occur and phrases satisfying the condition were considered an actual phrase. As candidate phrases were found, they were added to a PhraseTrie, an algorithm created for detecting real phrases. We could then use the PhraseTrie to retokenize the tokenized sentences with any phrases preserved as a single token. \\n\\nWe ran both word2vec and GloVe models with RAKE and trigram phrase detection algorithm on all PubMed and PMC articles. We observed that the results using trigram was noisy and less accurate; therefore models created using word2vec and RAKE were used for analysis. \\n\\nWe then used k-means clustering as previously discussed to group related word embeddings medical publications. \\n\\nOur eventual goal is to use word embedding methodologies to query research papers covering topics similar to a given paper. Doing so would require algorithms that variant of word embeddings, such as document embeddings or topic embeddings. Due to the complexity of this task, this process is not yet complete.\\n\\nRESULTS\\n\\nDoes this methodology identify known comorbid conditions and clinically meaningful groupings?\\n\\nInspecting the results of our k-means clustering algorithm applied to embedded medical codes, we are able to observe known relationships between conditions (specifically, comorbidities) using this methodology. However, we also see apparently unrelated medical codes within clusters. The inclusion these codes may indicate underlying relationships or simply be a symptom of imperfect datasets or modeling.F\\n\\nor example, the following three tables show the contents of the clusters most closely related to diabetes in the commercial dataset (figures 1\\xe2\\x80\\x933) and in the Medicare dataset (figure 4). Conditions known to be comorbid with diabetes that were also found in our analysis include skin ulcers, chronic kidney disease, and hyperlipidemia. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFigure 1. Medical codes related to diabetes, commercial cluster #1\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFigure 2. Medical codes related to diabetes, commercial cluster #2\\n\\nFigure 3. Medical codes related to diabetes, commercial cluster #3\\n\\n\\n\\nFigure 4. Medical codes related to diabetes, Medicare cluster\\n\\nHowever, we also see apparently unrelated medical codes within clusters. For example, it is unclear to us what relationship, if any, may exist between diabetes and lymphadenitis, though these were found to be in the same cluster by our algorithm. The inclusion these codes may indicate underlying relationships or simply be a symptom of imperfect datasets or modeling. On the other hand, we might think of these relationships as candidates for further exploration. \\n\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\nAre there notable similarities or differences between embeddings for the Medicare and commercial populations?\\n\\nWe found that most of the medical-code embeddings with the greatest differences were related to pregnancy and childbirth. This is not a surprising finding given that we expect the use of these codes to be extremely rare in the Medicare population. See figure 5\\xe2\\x80\\x94larger semantic displacement values closer indicate a greater difference between the term\\xe2\\x80\\x99s embedding for the commercial vs. the Medicare dataset.\\n\\n\\n\\nCCS Codes\\n\\nCCS DIAGNOSIS CATEGORIES LABELS\\n\\nAverage Semantic Displacement\\n\\n192\\n\\nUmbilical cord complication\\n\\n1.10238\\n\\n189\\n\\nPrevious C-section\\n\\n1.018654\\n\\n186\\n\\nDiabetes or abnormal glucose tolerance complicating pregnancy; childbirth; or the puerperium\\n\\n0.980251\\n\\n196\\n\\nOther pregnancy and delivery including normal\\n\\n0.91775\\n\\n218\\n\\nLiveborn\\n\\n0.856532\\n\\n177\\n\\nSpontaneous abortion\\n\\n0.805067\\n\\n56\\n\\nCystic fibrosis\\n\\n0.790847\\n\\n174\\n\\nFemale infertility\\n\\n0.780445\\n\\n176\\n\\nContraceptive and procreative management\\n\\n0.77457\\n\\n171\\n\\nMenstrual disorders\\n\\n0.757658\\n\\n184\\n\\nEarly or threatened labor\\n\\n0.713351\\n\\n193\\n\\nOB-related trauma to perineum and vulva\\n\\n0.627913\\n\\n182\\n\\nHemorrhage during pregnancy; abruptio placenta; placenta previa\\n\\n0.622847\\n\\n221\\n\\nRespiratory distress syndrome\\n\\n0.620349\\n\\n650\\n\\nAdjustment disorders\\n\\n0.616914\\n\\n653\\n\\nDelirium, dementia, and amnestic and other cognitive disorders\\n\\n0.597791\\n\\n169\\n\\nEndometriosis\\n\\n0.589144\\n\\n655\\n\\nDisorders usually diagnosed in infancy, childhood, or adolescence\\n\\n0.567096\\n\\n658\\n\\nPersonality disorders\\n\\n0.549973\\n\\n124\\n\\nAcute and chronic tonsillitis\\n\\n0.537227\\n\\n\\n\\nFigure 5.

Top 20 most similar AHRQ categories\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIs a predictive model that incorporates word embedding useful for predicting future costs?\\n\\nWe trained our sLDA cost prediction model on xxx individuals, while retaining yyy in a holdout set. Model results are promising, but only moderately predictive using word embedding alone (R2=0.26 for test data, 0.22 for holdout dataset). In the future, we believe we could substantially improve the accuracy these models by incorporating demographic information. Existing commercial risk adjustment methods in the literature report an R2 value of around 0.35; these methods include demographic information along with previous diagnoses. \\n\\nAre there potential \\xe2\\x80\\x9cadjacent possible ideas\\xe2\\x80\\x9d to explore based on the results of word embedding applied to PubMed articles?\\n\\nGrouping related concepts\\n\\nOur methodology was able to group similar concepts in research literature. For example:\\n\\nApproaches to monitoring glucose, (e.g., fasting serum glucose levels, postprandial glucose level, LDL cholesterol concentration, fasting plasma glucose concentrations, etc.) \\n\\nTypes of epidemic outbreaks (e.g., influenza, the Spanish flu, choler, etc.)\\n\\nTypes of biological effects (e.g., carcinogenic effects, regulatory effects, immunosuppressive effects, etc.)\\n\\nConcepts of interest in systems biology (e.g., applied systems biology, cancer growth genes, breast cancer proteomics, etc.)\\n\\nMedical universities with active research on PubMed\\n\\nIdentifying \\xe2\\x80\\x9cadjacent possible ideas\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nUsing this methodology, we can observe less-obvious comorbidities between medical conditions. For example, our analysis indicates connections between the following conditions:\\n\\nDiabetes and sleep disorders\\n\\nDiabetes and depression\\n\\nDiabetes and prostate cancer\\n\\nLeukemia and pancreatic cancer\\n\\nDialysis and hepatitis\\n\\nProstate cancer and blindness\\n\\nThese and other relationships that we found in the analysis are also observed in research literature.'\n",

Elyse!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nThe very thing the 16 skiers and snowboarders had sought \\xe2\\x80\\x94 fresh, soft snow \\xe2\\x80\\x94 instantly became the enemy. Somewhere above, a pristine meadow cracked in the shape of a lightning bolt, slicing a slab nearly 200 feet across and 3 feet deep. Gravity did the rest.\\n\\nSnow shattered and spilled down the slope. Within seconds, the avalanche was the size of more than a thousand cars barreling down the mountain and weighed millions of pounds. Moving about 7o miles per hour, it crashed through the sturdy old-growth trees, snapping their limbs and shredding bark from their trunks.\\n\\nThe avalanche, in Washington\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Cascades in February, slid past some trees and rocks, like ocean swells around a ship\\xe2\\x80\\x99s prow. Others it captured and added to its violent load.\\n\\nSomewhere inside, it also carried people. How many, no one knew.\\n\\nThe slope of the terrain, shaped like a funnel, squeezed the growing swell of churning snow into a steep, twisting gorge. It moved in surges, like a roller coaster on a series of drops and high-banked turns. It accelerated as the slope steepened and the weight of the slide pushed from behind. It slithered through shallower pitches. The energy raised the temperature of the snow a couple of degrees, and the friction carved striations high in the icy sides of the canyon walls.\\n\\nElyse Saugstad, a professional skier, wore a backpack equipped with an air bag, a relatively new and expensive part of the arsenal that backcountry users increasingly carry to ease their minds and increase survival odds in case of an avalanche. About to be overtaken, she pulled a cord near her chest. She was knocked down before she knew if the canister of compressed air inflated winged pillows behind her head.\\n\\nShe had no control of her body as she tumbled downhill. She did not know up from down. It was not unlike being cartwheeled in a relentlessly crashing wave. But snow does not recede. It swallows its victims. It does not spit them out.\\n\\nSnow filled her mouth. She caromed off things she never saw, tumbling through a cluttered canyon like a steel marble falling through pins in a pachinko machine.\\n\\nAt first she thought she would be embarrassed that she had deployed her air bag, that the other expert skiers she was with, more than a dozen of them, would have a good laugh at her panicked overreaction. Seconds later, tumbling uncontrollably inside a ribbon of speeding snow, she was sure this was how she was going to die.\\n\\nMoving, roiling snow turns into something closer to liquid, thick like lava. But when it stops, it instantly freezes solid. The laws of physics and chemistry transform a meadow of fine powder into a wreckage of icy chunks. Saugstad\\xe2\\x80\\x99s pinwheeling body would freeze into whatever position it was in the moment the snow stopped.\\n\\nAfter about a minute, the creek bed vomited the debris into a gently sloped meadow. Saugstad felt the snow slow and tried to keep her hands in front of her. She knew from avalanche safety courses that outstretched hands might puncture the ice surface and alert rescuers. She knew that if victims ended up buried under the snow, cupped hands in front of the face could provide a small pocket of air for the mouth and nose. Without it, the first breaths could create a suffocating ice mask.\\n\\nThe avalanche spread and stopped, locking everything it carried into an icy cocoon. It was now a jagged, virtually impenetrable pile of ice, longer than a football field and nearly as wide. As if newly plowed, it rose in rugged contrast to the surrounding fields of undisturbed snow, 20 feet tall in spots.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98I Couldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t Breathe\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\nSaugstad was mummified. She was on her back, her head pointed downhill. Her goggles were off. Her nose ring had been ripped away. She felt the crushing weight of snow on her chest. She could not move her legs. One boot still had a ski attached to it. She could not lift her head because it was locked into the ice.\\n\\nBut she could see the sky. Her face was covered only with loose snow. Her hands, too, stuck out of the snow, one still covered by a pink mitten.\\n\\nA narrative of interwoven words and multimedia.\\n\\nUsing her hands like windshield wipers, she tried to flick snow away from her mouth. When she clawed at her chest and neck, the crumbs maddeningly slid back onto her face. She grew claustrophobic.\\n\\nBreathe easy, she told herself. Do not panic. Help will come. She stared at the low, gray clouds. She had not noticed the noise as she hurtled down the mountain. Now, she was suddenly struck by the silence.\\n\\nTunnel Creek\\n\\nThe Cascades are among the craggiest of American mountain ranges, roughly cut, as if carved with a chain saw. In summer, the gray peaks are sprinkled with glaciers. In winter, they are smothered in some of North America\\xe2\\x80\\x99s deepest snowpack.\\n\\nThe top of Cowboy Mountain, about 75 miles east of Seattle, rises to 5,853 feet \\xe2\\x80\\x94 about half the height of the tallest Cascades, but higher than its nearest neighbors, enough to provide 360-degree views. It feels more like a long fin than a summit, a few feet wide in parts. Locals call it Cowboy Ridge.\\n\\nTo one side, down steep chutes, is Stevens Pass ski area, which receives about 400,000 visitors each winter. To the other, outside the ski area\\xe2\\x80\\x99s boundary to what is considered the back of Cowboy Mountain, is an unmonitored play area of reliably deep snow, a \\xe2\\x80\\x9cpowder stash,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d known as Tunnel Creek.\\n\\nIt is a term with broad meaning. The name is derived from the Cascade Tunnel, originally a 2.6-mile railroad tube completed in 1900 that connected the east and west sides of the Cascades, a boon for the growth of Seattle and Puget Sound. The mountain pass that it burrowed beneath was named for the project\\xe2\\x80\\x99s engineer, John Frank Stevens, who later helped build the Panama Canal.\\n\\nWreckage after the Wellington, Wash., avalanche in 1910, which buried two passenger trains marooned by snowstorms outside the Cascade Tunnel and killed 96 people. Rescue workers transported bodies from the scene on sleds. Museum of History &amp; Industry\\n\\nIn late February 1910, ceaseless snowstorms over several days marooned two passenger trains just outside the tunnel\\xe2\\x80\\x99s west portal. Before the tracks could be cleared, the trains were buried by what still stands as the nation\\xe2\\x80\\x99s deadliest avalanche. It killed 96 people.\\n\\nBodies were extricated and wrapped in blankets from the Great Northern Railway, then hauled away on sleds. Some were not found until the snow melted many months later.\\n\\nTo skiers and snowboarders today, Tunnel Creek is a serendipitous junction of place and powder. It features nearly 3,000 vertical feet \\xe2\\x80\\x94 a rarely matched descent \\xe2\\x80\\x94 of open meadows framed by thick stands of trees. Steep gullies drain each spring\\xe2\\x80\\x99s runoff to the valley floor and into a small, short gorge called Tunnel Creek.\\n\\nThe area has all of the alluring qualities of the backcountry \\xe2\\x80\\x94 fresh snow, expert terrain and relative solitude \\xe2\\x80\\x94 but few of the customary inconveniences. Reaching Tunnel Creek from Stevens Pass ski area requires a ride of just more than five minutes up SkyLine Express, a high-speed four-person chairlift, followed by a shorter ride up Seventh Heaven, a steep two-person lift. Slip through the open boundary gate, with its \\xe2\\x80\\x9ccontinue at your own risk\\xe2\\x80\\x9d warning signs, and hike 10 minutes to the top of Cowboy Mountain.\\n\\nWhen snow conditions are right, the preferred method of descent used by those experienced in Tunnel Creek, based on the shared wisdom passed over generations, is to hopscotch down the mountain through a series of long meadows. Weave down the first meadow, maybe punctuate the run with a jump off a rock outcropping near the bottom, then veer hard left, up and out of the narrowing gully and into the next open glade.\\n\\nAnother powder-filled drop ends with another hard left, into another meadow that leads to the valley floor.\\n\\nAllure of the Backcountry\\n\\nTunnel Creek is, in the vernacular of locals, a \\xe2\\x80\\x9chippie pow run\\xe2\\x80\\x9d \\xe2\\x80\\x94 breezy and unobstructed, the kind that makes skiers giggle in glee as they descend through a billowing cloud of their own soft powder and emerge at the bottom coated in white frosting.\\n\\nDespite trends toward extreme skiing (now called freeskiing), with improbable descents over cliffs and down chutes that test the guile of even the fiercest daredevils, the ageless lure of fresh, smooth powder endures.\\n\\nBut powder and people are key ingredients for avalanches. And the worry among avalanche forecasters, snow-science experts and search-and-rescue leaders is that the number of fatalities \\xe2\\x80\\x94 roughly 200 around the world each year \\xe2\\x80\\x94 will keep rising as the rush to the backcountry continues among skiers, snowboarders, climbers and snowmobilers.\\n\\nThe backcountry represents the fastest-growing segment of the ski industry. More than ever, people are looking for fresh descents accessible by helicopters, hiking or even the simple ride up a chairlift.\\n\\nBefore 1980, it was unusual to have more than 10 avalanche deaths in the United States each winter. There were 34 last season, including 20 skiers and snowboarders. Eight victims were skiing out of bounds, legally, with a lift ticket. And many of the dead were backcountry experts intimate with the terrain that killed them.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a cultural shift, where more skiers are going farther, faster, bigger,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said John Stifter, the editor of Powder magazine, who was a part of the group at Tunnel Creek in February. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhich is tending to push your pro skiers or other experienced, elite-level backcountry skiers that much farther, faster and bigger, to the point where there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s no margin for error.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nNo one knows how many avalanches occur. Most naturally triggered slides are never seen. Those set off by humans are rarely reported unless they cause fatalities or property damage.\\n\\nBut avalanches occur in Tunnel Creek regularly. Its slopes, mostly from 40 to 45 degrees, are optimal for avalanches \\xe2\\x80\\x94 flat enough to hold deep reservoirs of snow, yet steep enough for the snow to slide long distances when prompted. The long elevation drop means snow can be fluffy at the top and slushy at the bottom. Temperatures, wind and precipitation change quickly, and something as welcome as a burst of sunshine can alter the crystallized bonds deep inside the snow. And because Tunnel Creek is outside the ski area, it is not patrolled or specifically assessed for danger.\\n\\nIn March 2011, a University of Washington student was caught in an avalanche in Tunnel Creek. Having been carried into a stand of trees, he was unburied by friends within minutes and found dead. Three others were partially buried about an hour later when the ski patrol\\xe2\\x80\\x99s arrival set off a second avalanche.\\n\\nMany of the most experienced locals view Tunnel Creek with a mix of awe and fear.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve always been a naysayer of Tunnel Creek,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d the snowboarder Tim Wesley said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve seen a big avalanche back there before. It has about 2,600 vertical feet. Not typical. The snow changes a lot in that distance. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the reason I always have a second thought about Tunnel Creek. In Washington, there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a saying: If you don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t like the weather, wait five minutes. And it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s true. You\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll be on the chair and it\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll be freezing, and then all of a sudden there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a warm breeze that smells like the ocean.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nEven those who are not leery of Tunnel Creek on the best days heed the pass-it-on warning of the experienced: stay left.\\n\\nTo head straight down to the bottom is to enter what experts call a terrain trap: a funnel of trouble and clumsy skiing, clogged with trees and rocks and confined by high walls. Few go that way intentionally.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nChris Rudolph, the effervescent 30-year-old marketing manager for Stevens Pass, knew the preferred route down. Tunnel Creek was his favorite at-work diversion. Earlier that weekend, he mentioned plans for a field trip to Tunnel Creek to a select group of high-powered guests and close friends.\\n\\nThe operations manager for Stevens Pass agreed to pick up the group in one of the ski area\\xe2\\x80\\x99s trucks at the end of its descent. From the bottom of Tunnel Creek, it is about a half-mile trek through deep snow to U.S. 2, then a four-mile ride back to Stevens Pass.\\n\\nAt 11:32 a.m. on Sunday, Feb. 19, heading up the mountain, Rudolph sent a text message to the operations manager.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cA big posse,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Rudolph wrote.\\n\\nA Plan in Motion\\n\\nLike many ideas that sound good at the time, skiing Tunnel Creek was an idea hatched in a bar.\\n\\nIt was Saturday, Feb. 18, the afternoon light fading to dusk. Outside the Foggy Goggle, a bar at the base of the ski area, the snow continued to fall, roughly an inch an hour. By morning, there would be 32 inches of fresh snow at Stevens Pass, 21 of them in a 24-hour period of Saturday and Saturday night.\\n\\nThat was cause for celebration. It had been more than two weeks since the last decent snowfall. Finally, the tired layer of hard, crusty snow was gone, buried deep under powder.\\n\\nRudolph promoted Stevens Pass with restless zeal. In seven years there, he helped turn a relatively small, roadside ski area into a hip destination.\\n\\nHe unabashedly courted ski journalists and filmmakers to take a look. They, in turn, gave Stevens Pass star turns in magazines and popular ski movies, raising the area\\xe2\\x80\\x99s cool quotient.\\n\\nRudolph was the oldest of three children raised in California\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Bay Area by outdoors-minded parents. The young family pulled a pop-up Coleman camper around the West and skied at the areas around Lake Tahoe. The grown siblings continued to vacation with their parents, climbing peaks like Mount Whitney in California and Mount Rainier in Washington.\\n\\nRudolph peppered his language with words like \\xe2\\x80\\x9crad\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and \\xe2\\x80\\x9cstoked.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d But he was no simple-minded ski bum. He was an Eagle Scout with a marketing degree. When he applied at Stevens Pass years earlier, he sent a video of himself speaking, skiing and mountain biking. He included a bag of popcorn for the viewer. He got the job.\\n\\nChildren knew Rudolph because he kept his pockets full of Stevens Pass stickers. He starred in self-deprecating Webcasts promoting Stevens Pass. He wrote poetry on his blog and strummed a guitar. He drank Pabst Blue Ribbon, the unofficial beer of irony and the hipster generation.\\n\\nTunnel Creek was where he took special guests. And it is where he wanted to take the tangled assortment of high-caliber skiers and industry insiders who, as if carried by the latest storm, had blown into Stevens Pass that weekend.\\n\\nMany of them happened into the Foggy Goggle on Saturday night.\\n\\nAmong them were professional skiers like Saugstad, 33, a former champion of the Freeride World Tour. There were reporters and editors from Powder magazine and ESPN. There were executives from ski equipment and apparel companies. There were Stevens Pass regulars, some with broad reputations in the niche world of skiing, glad to spend time with the assortment of guests.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt was a very, very deep, heavy, powerful, strong group of pro skiers and ski industry people,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Keith Carlsen, a photographer and former editor of Powder.\\n\\nRudolph was the connecting thread. Some visitors, like Saugstad, were at Stevens Pass for a promotional event aimed at expert female skiers, sponsored by Salomon, the ski equipment maker. Rudolph skied with the group all day Saturday. He organized and hosted a catered dinner for the women later that night in Leavenworth, a serious outdoors town dressed as a Bavarian village, 35 miles downhill to the east.\\n\\nPowder had come to spotlight Stevens Pass for a feature article on night skiing. When the magazine\\xe2\\x80\\x99s editor, John Stifter, arrived by train to Leavenworth two days earlier, he found Rudolph\\xe2\\x80\\x99s car waiting for him. Inside were keys to the car, keys to a slope-side cabin and two Pabst Blue Ribbons in the cup holders.\\n\\nAt the bar, Rudolph mentioned an idea to a few people: Tunnel Creek on Sunday. Invitations traveled in whispers and text messages, through a knot of friendships and slight acquaintances.\\n\\nMeet at the fire pit, on the stone deck at Granite Peaks Lodge, at 11. Rudolph thought his Sunday morning staff meeting would end by then.\\n\\nChris Rudolph\\n\\n30, Director of marketing at Stevens Pass\\n\\nView Slideshow\\n\\nElyse Saugstad\\n\\n33, Professional freeskier\\n\\nView Slideshow\\n\\nKeith Carlsen\\n\\n38, Photographer and former editor of Powder\\n\\nView Slideshow\\n\\nJohn Stifter\\n\\n29, Editor of Powder magazine\\n\\nView Slideshow\\n\\nAs darkness enveloped Stevens Pass on Saturday night, stadium-style lights flooded the slopes in white light, and snowflakes fell in cotton-ball clumps.\\n\\nRudolph and those with the Salomon event left for dinner in Leavenworth. Stifter, 29, and Carlsen, 38, headed outside to work on their article for Powder.\\n\\nSeveral of those with plans to ski Tunnel Creek the next day huddled around a fire in front of Tim Wangen\\xe2\\x80\\x99s trailer. Among the assembled were Jim Jack, in red pants, and Tiffany Abraham, in red jacket. Keith Carlsen\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI skied just off the trail, not out of bounds, but in the ski resort, to shoot some of these night shots I took,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Carlsen said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnd in tree wells I was, like, neck deep \\xe2\\x80\\x94 easily nipple deep, wading around in snow, trying to get my angle. There was so much new snow.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nWith the daytime crowds gone, the nighttime atmosphere was festive and the faces were familiar. Families played in the deepening snow. More serious skiers and snowboarders sought the freshest powder.\\n\\nThere are no public accommodations at Stevens Pass, only a parking lot available to a few dozen campers and recreational vehicles. As the evening wound down, several of those with loose plans to ski Tunnel Creek the next morning huddled in the R.V. lot around a fire. Carlsen continued taking photographs. Stifter and others ducked inside one camper to watch homemade videos of others skiing Tunnel Creek over the past couple of decades.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cSo it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s something they skied often,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Stifter said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cNot something like, \\xe2\\x80\\x98We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to go ski Tunnel!\\xe2\\x80\\x99 Not like a once-a-year deal.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nThe flames in the fire died to orange embers. The last beers were sipped empty, and people slipped into the night. The campers were blanketed with snow.\\n\\nBeyond the lights glowing from the ski area, snow still fell over the ridge, too, in the vast darkness of steep meadows and narrow gullies just past the western edge of Stevens Pass.\\n\\nEach snowflake added to the depth, and each snowflake added to the weight. It might take a million snowflakes for a skier to notice the difference. It might take just one for a mountain to move.\\n\\nA large storm produced 32 inches of snow at Stevens Pass in the three days before the avalanche.\\n\\nThe new snow put an increasing load on a fragile crust.\\n\\nPart Two\\n\\nTo the Peak\\n\\nDawn cracked with the intermittent sound of explosives near the top of Cowboy Mountain. Stevens Pass ski patrollers, called to duty whenever more than a few inches of snow fell, had arrived to check and control the ski area\\xe2\\x80\\x99s 200 inbounds avalanche zones.\\n\\nAfter getting the latest assessment from the area\\xe2\\x80\\x99s full-time avalanche forecaster, more than a dozen patrollers filled their backpacks with 2.2-pound emulsion charges, shaped like cartoon dynamite. Chairlifts rumbled to life, ferrying the crews up the dark mountain.\\n\\nThree two-person teams assigned to Cowboy Ridge removed their skis and filed through the boundary gate. They took turns plowing a path through the fresh snow with their bodies. Their boots forged an icy stairway to the top of the skinny ridge.\\n\\nBack on their skis, facing down into the ski area and with their backs to Tunnel Creek, they spread across the ridge to stamp and destroy wind-swept cornices, small balconies of crusty snow.\\n\\nThey removed the charges from their packs. Like party poppers that spew confetti, charges have a pull-wire, an ignition that lights a 90-second fuse. The patrollers lobbed the lighted charges into the many steep chutes below them. With muffled booms, heavy waves of snow tumbled harmlessly into the recesses of the empty slopes below, clearing danger for the day\\xe2\\x80\\x99s thousands of inbounds customers.\\n\\nThe lines for the ski lifts began forming about 7, two hours before they were to open. When the gathering skiers and snowboarders heard the explosions echo down the mountain, they cheered. It signaled a powder day.\\n\\nIn Leavenworth, Chris Rudolph awoke in his two-bedroom house on Ash Street, the one that he and his girlfriend, Anne Hessburg, painted a rich blue and accented with a garden out front.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cChris was so mad that he had a meeting,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Hessburg said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt was a pow day, and you couldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t tie him to his desk on pow days.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nBut he thought the meeting would end by 11.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHe said: \\xe2\\x80\\x98It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s going to be so good, babe. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m going to take some folks up to Tunnel Creek,\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Hessburg said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cTunnel Creek, it was kind of like the holy grail for Chris. It was where he wanted to show off for friends.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nAmong those who joined the 45-minute parade from Leavenworth, through tight Tumwater Canyon, past the Lake Wenatchee turnoff and up to Stevens Pass, were Dan Abrams and Megan Michelson. They planned to marry in March.\\n\\nMichelson, 30, was the freeskiing editor for ESPN.com. Abrams, 34, was a founder and the president of Flylow, maker of apparel marketed to backcountry users.\\n\\nThe couple lived in Seattle, but had come to Stevens Pass on Saturday for the Salomon promotional event. Michelson and the other women stayed at a Leavenworth hotel. Abrams slept in a spare bedroom at Rudolph\\xe2\\x80\\x99s house. He and Michelson drove to Stevens Pass together.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI said to Dan, \\xe2\\x80\\x98Do you think Tunnel will be safe today?\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Michelson said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHe said something along the lines of, \\xe2\\x80\\x98Yeah, those guys know the best route down.\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nThere were similar conversations elsewhere. In the slope-side cabin at Stevens Pass that Rudolph arranged \\xe2\\x80\\x94 he cleaned it on Friday as he spoke to his mother on the phone \\xe2\\x80\\x94 the journalists from Powder magazine, Stifter and Carlsen, contemplated the day\\xe2\\x80\\x99s plans.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe started asking questions,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Carlsen said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9c\\xe2\\x80\\x98Where are we going? Out of bounds? Didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t it just snow nonstop for two days? How much snow?\\xe2\\x80\\x99 That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s when John pulled up the avalanche report, and he read it aloud.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nPredicting Avalanches\\n\\nMark Moore, director and lead meteorologist of the Northwest Weather and Avalanche Center, had set that day\\xe2\\x80\\x99s forecast on Saturday afternoon. A 64-year-old with graying hair pulled into a short ponytail, Moore had a feeling it could be a busy weekend.\\n\\nThe avalanche center, based in Seattle, is one of about 20 regional avalanche forecasting centers in the United States, most run by the Forest Service. During the winter, one of its three employees arrives in the middle of the night, analyzes weather maps and computer models, and examines data \\xe2\\x80\\x94 snowfall, temperatures, wind, humidity and so on \\xe2\\x80\\x94 from 47 remote weather stations scattered across the mountains, including five in the vicinity of Stevens Pass. They take calls from ski patrollers and highway crews.\\n\\nThe biggest storm of the season increased avalanche concerns. But it was not just the new snow that concerned Moore. It was what lay nearly three feet beneath \\xe2\\x80\\x94 a thin layer of perfectly preserved frost called surface hoar. The frozen equivalent of dew, created on crisp, clear nights, it features fragile, featherlike crystals that grow skyward.\\n\\nOn the surface, they glimmer like a million tiny diamonds. When frosted and protected by soft blankets of fluffy snow, they are weak stilts supporting all that falls on top. When they finally give way, falling like microscopic dominoes on a steep slope, they provide an icy flume for the snow above.\\n\\nA shot of rain or above-freezing temperatures, both common in Cascade winters, usually destroy the fragile crystals, melding them into the snowpack. But five days of dry, cold weather, from Feb. 3 to 7, created a perfect, sparkly layer of surface hoar. Sporadic light snow, never more than an inch or two a day, delicately shrouded it over the next 10 days.\\n\\nBy the weekend, as snow fell heavily over the Cascades and powder-hungry hordes took to the slopes, the old layer was long out of sight, and mostly out of mind.\\n\\nNot to Moore.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cSnowpack is never static,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s changing, even once it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s buried.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nChanges in temperatures, precipitation, humidity and wind can turn a benign snowpack into a deadly one, and vice versa. Sometimes weather is enough to start an avalanche. But \\xe2\\x80\\x9cnatural\\xe2\\x80\\x9d avalanches rarely kill. The majority of avalanche fatalities are in human-triggered slides \\xe2\\x80\\x94 usually of the victims\\xe2\\x80\\x99 own making.\\n\\nDan Abrams\\n\\n34, Co-founder, Flylow ski apparel, fianc\\xc3\\xa9 of Megan Michelson\\n\\nView Slideshow\\n\\nMegan Michelson\\n\\n30, Freeskiing editor, ESPN.com, fianc\\xc3\\xa9e of Dan Abrams\\n\\nView Slideshow\\n\\nPlay or swipe through\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cEvery skier, everyone who hits the slope, changes the structure of the snowpack,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Moore said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cEven though they don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know it.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nIn the rugged area of the Cascades that includes Stevens Pass, Moore deemed the avalanche danger \\xe2\\x80\\x9chigh\\xe2\\x80\\x9d \\xe2\\x80\\x94 the fourth degree out of five \\xe2\\x80\\x94 for slopes above 5,000 feet in elevation, facing north to southeast.\\n\\nFor everything else, the danger level was deemed \\xe2\\x80\\x9cconsiderable,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d defined as \\xe2\\x80\\x9cdangerous avalanche conditions\\xe2\\x80\\x9d with \\xe2\\x80\\x9chuman-triggered avalanches likely.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nThe top of Cowboy Mountain is nearly 6,000 feet. The Tunnel Creek terrain descends off its southwest side to roughly 3,000 feet. Officially, the danger was \\xe2\\x80\\x9cconsiderable.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIn avalanche forecasting terms, \\xe2\\x80\\x98considerable\\xe2\\x80\\x99 is a really weird forecast,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Saugstad said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBecause it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s this gray area. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a hard one to predict. It can mean, well, you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re not going to see any activity. Or, if something goes, you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to be screwed. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s hard to work with that one.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nMoore\\xe2\\x80\\x99s forecast offered more specifics.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAlthough decreasing light showers and decreasing winds are expected Sunday, cold temperatures should slow stabilization of existing wind slabs and help maintain the threat of further human-triggered avalanche activity, especially on previously wind-loaded terrain showing no evidence of recent avalanche activity,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Moore wrote.\\n\\nSpotty afternoon sunshine, he added, could raise the danger, especially on south-facing slopes.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nThe snow had stopped at Stevens Pass by the time the lifts opened Sunday morning. The runs were quickly doodled with curvy lines.\\n\\nStifter sat in the cabin and examined the forecast on his laptop.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI have this image burned in my head,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Stifter said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI had a coffee cup in my right hand, I was reading e-mails, and I read the Northwest Avalanche Center report. And it said \\xe2\\x80\\x98considerable to high\\xe2\\x80\\x99 was the avalanche danger. And I read it out loud to Keith. And he listened, and I read it again \\xe2\\x80\\x94 I read it twice \\xe2\\x80\\x94 and looked at it. Huh. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve skied enough to know that when it snows a lot, which it did, up to two feet, there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s always going to be instability, with that much weight on an older snowpack.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nStifter left Carlsen behind and headed to the lifts. He found Jim Jack. If anyone could judge terrain and snow in the backcountry, it was Jim Jack.\\n\\nThe license plate on Jack\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Subaru Brat as a teenager read \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIM JIM.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d To family and his closest friends, he was Jimmy, sometimes J.J. To most everyone else, he was Jim Jack, blended into one name, accent on the first syllable: JIM-jack.\\n\\nJack was the head judge and former president of the International Freeskiers Association, which oversaw a world tour of competitions. At 46, he was a sort of Peter Pan of the ski world, a charismatic, carefree boy who never grew up, beloved by like-minded skiers and snowboarders half his age.\\n\\nHe spent winters traveling the world, spreading the gospel of freeskiing, professing the beauty of finding improbable ways down precarious slopes with grace, nerve and flair. He had been a competitor on the tour, distinguishable from great distances by the silkiness of his loose form, until he landed hard and took his own knee to his face, shattering the bones around his right eye. You could feel the screws when you touched his face.\\n\\nHe was a party accelerator with a penchant for streaking. He did drama in high school and never declined the stage as an adult. On Halloween, his costumes played off his name: Jack on the Rocks, Jim Jack in the Box, Cracker Jack, Jack Frost.\\n\\nWearing lederhosen, Jack starred in a cheeky promotional video for Leavenworth. He was a sure-handed shortstop for the team from Uncle Uli\\xe2\\x80\\x99s, a bar and restaurant in the heart of town. A grilled chicken sandwich on the menu, smothered in spicy sauce, is named the Napkin\\xe2\\x80\\x99 Slappin\\xe2\\x80\\x99 Jim Jack.\\n\\nJack shared a bungalow off the highway, near the Howard Johnson, with his longtime girlfriend, Tiffany Abraham. They danced late at night in the kitchen and built bonfires in the backyard. The covered front porch held a pile of ski gear and a futon couch, perfect for watching the world go by, beer in hand.\\n\\nJack drove a 1994 Chevy pickup with 216,000 miles on it, topped by a Wilderness camper that he added for $350. Widely recognized on the highways and in ski area parking lots around the West, it was held together largely by duct tape and bungee cords. The radio\\xe2\\x80\\x99s volume was stuck on high. If it is too loud, Jack told passengers, just roll down the window.\\n\\nJack and his camper rolled into the R.V. parking lot at Stevens Pass on Friday night. On weekends, when the snow was good, the lot filled with dozens of pickup campers and motor homes.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI woke up on Saturday in my R.V.,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Tim Wangen, a 53-year-old former commercial diver who lived in a cabin at nearby Lake Wenatchee. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhen I wake up, I look outside to see who is next to me. I saw that Jim Jack was next to me. I thought, cool, I got a great neighbor this week.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nJack and Wangen had skied a couple of runs Sunday morning by the time Stifter caught up to them. Wangen knew Tunnel Creek as well as anyone, having skied it since he was a boy. Jack traveled the world, scouting courses for extreme skiing. He knew how to avoid danger.\\n\\nStifter asked Jack about the avalanche report.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHe\\xe2\\x80\\x99s like: \\xe2\\x80\\x98Yeah, not to worry,\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Stifter said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9c\\xe2\\x80\\x98We\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll just do it slowly and safely and just stay in the trees.\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98Gear Up?\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\nThe fire pit sits at the center of the bustle on busy days. At the corner of the patio, in front of the lodge, it is a crossroads for people coming and going. Some pull up chairs and relax, facing the bowl of ski runs strung before them. When the clouds lift, Cowboy Mountain dominates the view high to the right. It can feel close enough to reach and touch.\\n\\nBy midmorning, the fire pit began attracting a growing but confused band of expert skiers. Some were local, some were visitors. Some knew others, some did not, but most knew either Chris Rudolph or Jim Jack. They traded nods and handshakes, unsure if others were headed to Tunnel Creek, too.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know why everyone was there,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Dan Abrams, there with Megan Michelson. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe wondered if everyone was meeting up for the same reason. But it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s like when you find out where the extra keg is at the party. You don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t go tell everybody.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nJoel Hammond, the 37-year-old regional sales representative for Salomon, had teamed with Rudolph to organize the previous day\\xe2\\x80\\x99s women\\xe2\\x80\\x99s event. He did not intend to ski Sunday until he awoke in Leavenworth and could not resist the lure of the fresh snow. He drove to Stevens Pass and sent a text message to Rudolph, still in a staff meeting.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cChris was like: \\xe2\\x80\\x98Meet at the fire pit, where everybody meets. Then we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to rally up,\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Hammond said.\\n\\nHammond told Jack that he had the latest model of skis in his truck, then left to retrieve a pair for him to try. Stifter bought coffee, a couple of Americanos, from the stand for himself and Jack.\\n\\nTim Carlson and Ron Pankey, both 37 and childhood friends from Vermont, had spent the morning on the inbounds side of Cowboy Mountain, navigating near-vertical chutes and rock outcroppings. During a break, they spotted familiar faces near the fire pit.\\n\\nPankey was a former competitor on the Freeskiing World Tour, so he had known Jack since the mid-1990s. Like Jack, he eventually worked competitions around the world, including the X Games.\\n\\nCarlson was a snowboarder, not a skier, and a regular at Stevens Pass. Earlier that week, he competed at Washington\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Crystal Mountain. Jack worked the event, and Carlson slept several nights in Jack\\xe2\\x80\\x99s camper.\\n\\nWhen Carlson and Pankey arrived at Stevens Pass that Sunday, they joined Tim Wesley, known to most as Tall Tim \\xe2\\x80\\x94 a lanky 39-year-old snowboarder from Leavenworth. The three merged with those waiting for Rudolph.\\n\\nAnother arrival was Wenzel Peikert, 29, an off-duty Stevens Pass ski instructor from Seattle. Skiing over the weekend without his wife and infant daughter, he hung around the Foggy Goggle and the R.V. lot on Saturday night. He, too, sent a message to Rudolph on Sunday, confirming the plan.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI wrote, \\xe2\\x80\\x98Gear up?\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Peikert said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnd he wrote, \\xe2\\x80\\x98Yeah, for sure.\\xe2\\x80\\x99 So I went into the ski school and grabbed my pack, with my beacon, probe and shovel. I went to the fire pit and I met the whole group. You could tell they were a different level of skier by how they acted and how they dressed.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nAmong the strangers he saw was Rob Castillo, a 40-year-old father of two and former competitive skier. He had exchanged text messages with Jack.\\n\\nCastillo and Jack lived together in Alta, Utah, for several years in the 1990s. They went helicopter skiing in Alaska and skied down mountains they had climbed in Washington.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cTunnel Creek at 11,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Jack wrote.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cPerfect,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Castillo thought. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThat\\xe2\\x80\\x99s just what I wanted to do.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nAt the fire pit, Castillo considered the others.\\n\\nTim Wesley, a snowboarder known as Tall Tim, at his house in Leavenworth, Wash.

And they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re not going to bring people out who aren\\xe2\\x80\\x99t.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nMore than anything, Castillo wanted to ski for the first time all season with his two best friends at Stevens Pass \\xe2\\x80\\x93 Jack and Johnny Brenan.\\n\\nIn the R.V. parking lot, a few hundred yards away, Johnny and Laurie Brenan convened in their motor home for an early lunch with their daughters, Josie, 10, and Nina, 7, part of the Stevens Pass ski teams.\\n\\nBrenan, 41, grew up comfortably in the Seattle suburbs, not far from Jack. He followed his passion for skiing to Breckenridge, Colo., working as a ski patroller in the winter and a carpenter in the summer. A burly man whose five o\\xe2\\x80\\x99clock shadow arrived by noon each day, he eventually opened a business that he named for home: Cascade Contracting.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI met Johnny at the Gold Pan in Breckenridge,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Laurie Brenan said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt was Thursday night, 25-cent beer night. He was sitting on the pool table, and he had an open spot next to him. And I said, \\xe2\\x80\\x98I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m going to go sit next to that cute guy.\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nThey married in 1997 and moved to Leavenworth. Brenan worked as a cabinetmaker, then resurrected Cascade Contracting. On the strength of Brenan\\xe2\\x80\\x99s amicable personality and no-fear creativity, it blossomed with custom homes and expansive remodels.\\n\\nThe Brenans bought a deteriorated 100-year-old farmhouse on a hill in an apple orchard. Johnny Brenan lifted the structure on jacks, rebuilt the foundation and gutted the inside, intending to resell it as a bed-and-breakfast. The Brenans kept it for themselves to raise their family.\\n\\nBrenan zipped from one construction site to another in his truck. He coached soccer teams. He held Monday night poker games in the garage, which Nina always helped prepare. He built a chicken coop in the yard.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cJohnny and Josie bought five chickens, and they called the business Eggs, Ink,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Laurie Brenan said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThey had signs and business cards. Then they bought 30 more chickens. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s like, she\\xe2\\x80\\x99s 5 years old.

Brenan was at the front of the lift line at dawn.\\n\\nHe offered to fetch coffee for those behind him, a trick he used to keep his place while he helped Laurie get their daughters fed and dressed. He returned to the line, excited for an increasingly rare chance to ski with old friends like Jack.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI dropped the kids off for ski team about 8:45,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Laurie Brenan said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI remember looking down and Johnny was yelling at Jim Jack, doing something with his hands, something crazy. They were like little boys in a candy store. They were so excited.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nBack with his family for lunch, Brenan ate an egg sandwich and discussed a business deal on the phone. It was after 11, and he was afraid he would miss the Tunnel Creek run.\\n\\nBut Rudolph sent a couple of people text messages at about 11:15. He apologized for running late, and said he would be out in about 10 minutes.\\n\\nBrenan had time. He made a pact with Josie.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cJosie, be ready at 2,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Brenan said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI\\xe2\\x80\\x99m going to come back and we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll go on a powder mission. Be here, because I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll be here.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nBrenan strapped on his avalanche beacon, also called a transceiver, a device that emits a silent signal for others to detect your location in case of burial. A friend in the R.V. noted that its batteries were dead. Brenan replaced them with fresh ones.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat\\xe2\\x80\\x99s that, Papa?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Nina asked her father.\\n\\nBrenan paused to show her how it worked.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHe explained it,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Laurie Brenan said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt was understood that avalanche beacons were really for body recovery. Not many people survive avalanches. He would say that.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nBrenan gathered his things and headed toward the fire pit to join his friends.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI said, \\xe2\\x80\\x98Are you sure it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s safe?\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Laurie Brenan said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHe looked me right in the eye and said: \\xe2\\x80\\x98Of course. I wouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t be going if it weren\\xe2\\x80\\x99t.\\xe2\\x80\\x99 I said O.K. because I knew that was true.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nAt about 11:30, Rudolph burst through the doors of the lodge at Stevens Pass. He was surprised by the size of the group waiting for him, but he barely broke stride.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cGet me out of here before another spreadsheet finds me,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said.\\n\\nThe group, jolted into action, scattered to gather gear.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe all rallied up, jumped on the lifts,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Castillo said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI remember seeing some other buddies of mine later, like: \\xe2\\x80\\x98Oh, I wanted to go out so bad with you guys that day. It looked like such a fun crew.\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nThe Backcountry Beckons\\n\\nLooking south across U.S. 2, where Stevens Pass is nestled between Big Chief Mountain, left, and Cowboy Mountain, right, in the Cascades. Chase Jarvis\\n\\nStevens Pass opened in the winter of 1937-38 with a rope tow on Big Chief Mountain. A lodge and five new tows were added in the 1940s, including a mile-long T-bar that pulled people up the side of Cowboy Mountain. The ski area took shape in the bowl below the crescent-shape ridge that connects the two mountains.\\n\\nSeventh Heaven, a two-person lift up a steep wall of Cowboy Mountain, changed the complexion of Stevens Pass when it was built in 1960. It opened a high swath of expert terrain, now marked as double diamond \\xe2\\x80\\x94 experts only \\xe2\\x80\\x94 on posted signs and the ski map.\\n\\nIt also provided easy access to the top of the high ridgeline. Back then, few people dared to remove their skis and hike the few hundred extra feet to the summit. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhen I was younger at Stevens, no one skied off Cowboy \\xe2\\x80\\x94 maybe just a few locals,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Wangen, who has skied the area for nearly five decades. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBut the last 20 years, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s gone ballistic.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nNow there is a steady procession of expert skiers and snowboarders through the boundary gate next to the top of the lift. Most drop off the left side of the ridge, back into the resort, through the rocky and narrow chutes.\\n\\nThose who drop away from the ski area, toward Tunnel Creek, are simply following a much wider trend into \\xe2\\x80\\x9csidecountry\\xe2\\x80\\x9d \\xe2\\x80\\x94 backcountry slopes easily entered by lifts and, sometimes, a short hike.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t like the term \\xe2\\x80\\x98sidecountry,\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Moore, the avalanche forecaster, said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt makes it sound like \\xe2\\x80\\x98backcountry light.\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nThe rise of backcountry skiing can be credited to a collision of factors.\\n\\nSki areas that once vigilantly policed their boundaries, from Jackson Hole, Wyo., to Squaw Valley, Calif., have gradually opened their gates to the territory surrounding them. While that has led to wrangling over liability issues and raised debate over search-and-rescue responsibilities, most areas note that they are carved out of public land. They really cannot keep people from going there.\\n\\nBut ski areas also see the potential to attract more ticket-buying customers, and more influential ones, by blurring the boundary lines. Many areas slyly promote not just the terrain inside their borders, but the wilder topography beyond, using the power of media and word of mouth \\xe2\\x80\\x94 as Rudolph did for Stevens Pass.\\n\\nSkiing adjacent to ski areas, however, can numb people to risk. Easy access, familiar terrain and a belief that help is just a short distance away may lead people to descend slopes they might avoid in deeper wilderness.\\n\\nWhile most backcountry users would not consider entering known avalanche territory without a beacon, one study last winter at Loveland Ski Area in Colorado found that fewer than 40 percent of people who passed through a boundary gate wore one.\\n\\nEquipment advances have emboldened people. Intermediate powder skiers have been turned into expert ones thanks to fatter skis and the \\xe2\\x80\\x9crocker\\xe2\\x80\\x9d shape of their tips \\xe2\\x80\\x94 design advances borrowed from snowboarding. Popular ski bindings now temporarily detach at the heel, allowing skiers to glide up rises like a cross-country skier, then reconnect so they can descend like a professional downhiller.\\n\\nSnowboards have borrowed from skis, too. Some models can be quickly split into two pieces, allowing users to stride up short hills in pursuit of bigger descents.\\n\\nSimilar advances in safety gear, such as easy-to-use digital beacons and air bags, have helped make the backcountry feel less dangerous. Beacons help rescuers find people buried under the snow, while air bags deploy a large balloon meant to help keep the skier closer to the surface of an avalanche. A leading American manufacturer of safety gear is named, appropriately, Backcountry Access.\\n\\nCompanies, including Salomon and Flylow, have marketed heavily to ride the backcountry trend. They are keenly aware that many buyers will never ski the backcountry but want to dress the part.\\n\\nThose marketing shifts have coincided with a generation raised on the glorification of risk. From X Games to YouTube videos, helmet cameras to social media, the culture rewards vicarious thrills and video one-upmanship. This generation no longer automatically adheres to the axiom of waiting a day for safer conditions. The relative placidness of inbounds skiing is no match for the greater adventure of untamed terrain.\\n\\nAmong avalanche forecasters and the growing cottage industry of safety instructors, there is pride in noting that the number of fatalities has risen at a slower rate than the number of backcountry users. But they see themselves as part of a difficult race between the coming hordes and the tools to protect them.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou could argue that skiers have never been this educated or safe,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Stifter, the Powder magazine editor, said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThere\\xe2\\x80\\x99s been a huge emergence and emphasis on avalanche classes. Then you also have this lifesaving technology. But if you go to Jackson or Utah, you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll see people who are not educated, who are just going out there because they see it in the movies and they see it in magazines like Powder: there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s fresh tracks and, man, it looks like fun.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nAir bags are designed to keep a skier closer to the surface of an avalanche.\\n\\nAt the top of Seventh Heaven, the members of the group took off their skis and snowboards. Directly to the right of the lift\\xe2\\x80\\x99s unloading ramp was a narrow trail that disappeared up through a clog of trees.\\n\\nReaching Tunnel Creek from Stevens Pass ski area requires taking two lifts, slipping through the boundary gate, which was closed temporarily after the avalanche, then hiking to the top of Cowboy Mountain. Left, Stevens Pass Ski Patrol; right, Chase Jarvis\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cRead this,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d one sign read in all capital letters. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cSki Area Boundary. Minimum of $1000.00 rescue fee! Do you have a partner, beacon, probe and shovel? Explosives may be used in this area at any time. Continue at your own risk.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nA smaller sign read: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cStop. Ski Area Boundary. No ski patrol or snow control beyond this point.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nTo the right was a gray steel box. It was labeled, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAvalanche Transceiver Check Station.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou walk by and it goes beep, beep,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Rob Castillo said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cSo as we were going through, you heard it going all the way, right on everyone. Beep. Beep. Beep.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nWhile there are no laws dictating what equipment people carry into the backcountry, there is a code. Carry a beacon (for sending and receiving signals), a probe (for poking for victims in the snow) and a shovel (for digging them out).\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhen you go in the backcountry, you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re trusting your life in the hands of everybody else and they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re trusting their life in you,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Michelson said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIf I get buried and my ski partner doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have a beacon, shovel or probe, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s my life on the line.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nOne member of the party did not elicit a beep:  Erin Dessert, a 35-year-old snowboarder who was early for her afternoon shift as a Stevens Pass lift operator. Wesley invited her along. She thought everyone was riding off the front side of Cowboy Mountain, back into the ski area.\\n\\nThe group marched single file along the narrow ridge for a few minutes until it reached a wider area to convene. Tracks dropped back over a steep edge and into the ski area to the left.\\n\\nTo the right was nothing but deep powder, hidden by thick trees, like a curtain to the big attraction.\\n\\nErin Dessert\\n\\n35, Snowboarder, Stevens Pass lift operator\\n\\nView Slideshow\\n\\nPart Three\\n\\nThe Descent Begins\\n\\nDan Abrams\\n\\nJohnny Brenan\\n\\nKeith Carlsen\\n\\nTim Carlson\\n\\nRob Castillo\\n\\nErin Dessert\\n\\nJoel Hammond\\n\\nJim Jack\\n\\nMegan Michelson\\n\\nRon Pankey\\n\\nWenzel Peikert\\n\\nChris Rudolph\\n\\nElyse Saugstad\\n\\nJohn Stifter\\n\\nTim Wangen\\n\\nTim Wesley\\n\\nThere were 16 people, although no one thought to count at the time. Their ages ranged from 29 to 53.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThis was a crew that seemed like it was assembled by some higher force,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Dessert said.\\n\\nIt was about 11:45. The storm had passed. A low, pewter sky hid the surrounding peaks. Castillo glanced around at the others, wearing helmets and rainbow hues, a kaleidoscope of color amid the gray surroundings, like sprinkles on vanilla ice cream.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI was thinking, wow, what a bunch of heavies,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said.\\n\\nThere was loose banter and a few casual introductions. Not everyone met everyone else. Someone pulled out marijuana to smoke, and passed it.\\n\\nWesley, the snowboarder known as Tall Tim, saw the size of the assembled group. More than a dozen, he thought.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThat never happens,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnd it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s basically the legends of Stevens Pass standing up there.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nThere was little doubt that those with Tunnel Creek experience knew the way. About half the group had been down dozens of times each, if not hundreds. The others would follow.\\n\\nAmong the 16 skiers and snowboarders who congregated at the top of Cowboy Mountain were, from left, Ron Pankey, Chris Rudolph, Rob Castillo, Joel Hammond and Wenzel Peikert. Erin Dessert\\n\\nThere was no broad discussion of the route down. Pockets of the group talked about staying left, not being too greedy by going too far down the meadow before cutting across.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThat run, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not that it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s supersteep, or there are cliffs, or that it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a really rowdy run,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Carlson, one of the Stevens Pass regulars, said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s that if anything goes wrong, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a terrain trap. If somebody happens to set off even a slough slide and you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re below them in Tunnel, it all bottlenecks and really adds up superfast. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the reason that run is heavy. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s notorious.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nUnspoken anxiety spread among those unfamiliar with the descent. The mere size of the group spooked some. Backcountry users of all types \\xe2\\x80\\x94 skiers, snowboarders, snowmobilers and climbers \\xe2\\x80\\x94 worry about how much of a load a slope can absorb before it gives way. They worry about people above them causing an avalanche. When it comes to the backcountry, there is usually not safety in large numbers.\\n\\nThat is not only because of the physical impact on the snow. It is because of the complicated dynamics that large groups create. Deadly avalanches are usually the product of bad decisions \\xe2\\x80\\x94 human nature, not Mother Nature.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIf it was up to me, I would never have gone backcountry skiing with 12 people,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Michelson, the ESPN journalist, said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThat\\xe2\\x80\\x99s just way too many. But there were sort of the social dynamics of that \\xe2\\x80\\x94 where I didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t want to be the one to say, you know, \\xe2\\x80\\x98Hey, this is too big a group and we shouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t be doing this.\\xe2\\x80\\x99 I was invited by someone else, so I didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t want to stand up and cause a fuss. And not to play the gender card, but there were 2 girls and 10 guys, and I didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t want to be the whiny female figure, you know? So I just followed along.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nOthers suppressed reservations, too.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe whole thing felt rushed to me, and it felt kind of like this covert operation,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Stifter said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhich it kind of was, because you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going out of bounds. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s obviously acceptable, especially when you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going out there with all these locals and the director of marketing. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not illegal or anything. It just had this rushed feeling from the time Chris walked out of the office, and he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s like, \\xe2\\x80\\x98All right, let\\xe2\\x80\\x99s go.\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nCarlsen, Stifter\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Powder colleague, was uneasy. He tried to convince himself that it was a good idea.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThere\\xe2\\x80\\x99s no way this entire group can make a decision that isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t smart,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said to himself. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cOf course it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s fine, if we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re all going. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s got to be fine.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHike to Tunnel Creek\\n\\nChris Rudolph\\n\\nWesley, Pankeyand Carlson\\n\\nChris Rudolph\\n\\nElyse Saugstad\\n\\nRob Castillo\\n\\nJohnny Brenan\\n\\nTim Wangen\\n\\nWenzel Peikert\\n\\nJim Jack\\n\\n-->\\n\\nAfter a few minutes, the small talk faded. Worries went unexpressed.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhen you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re up on top of a peak like that, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s usually hang out for a second, and then it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s momentum,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Castillo said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou just kind of feel it. Everyone\\xe2\\x80\\x99s like: \\xe2\\x80\\x98O.K., we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re not here to hang out. Let\\xe2\\x80\\x99s start going.\\xe2\\x80\\x99 So I saw people starting to slide, get going, and I was like: \\xe2\\x80\\x98Hey, Johnny, partner up. Buddy system. Let\\xe2\\x80\\x99s go. Me and you.\\xe2\\x80\\x99 And at that point, it clicked. Everyone\\xe2\\x80\\x99s like, yeah, partners, partners, partners.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nIt is a tenet of avalanche safety, and the command snapped the group to attention.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cSomeone said, \\xe2\\x80\\x98Partner up \\xe2\\x80\\x94 everyone should grab a partner,\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Carlsen said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cImmediately I thought, We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re in a somewhat serious situation. It wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t just grab a partner so you don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t get lost. It was grab a partner so you. ...\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt just felt bigger all of a sudden.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nRudolph, the Stevens Pass marketing director, teamed with Saugstad, the professional skier.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI was really excited about that,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Saugstad said, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cbecause he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s just such a cool guy and I thought, wow, cool, he wants to be my partner. A very trustworthy guy that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s an amazing skier.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nJack, on borrowed Salomon skis, paired with Joel Hammond, the Salomon representative. Carlson looked at Pankey, his childhood friend.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cDude, you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re coming with me,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said.\\n\\nWesley gave a little whistle to Carlson and Pankey and nodded downhill. He wanted to be first. The conditions were too good to waste time, and he did not want to be slowed by the huge pack.\\n\\nWith little warning, Wesley dropped straight through the large cluster of trees, using firs as a slalom course. Pankey and Carlson followed.\\n\\nRudolph, always up for competition, sped around the trees, not through them. He curved around a banked C-shape turn that dropped him a couple hundred feet into the broad meadow below.\\n\\nHe arrived just in time to see Wesley, Pankey and Carlson burst from the trees into the open powder. Rudolph pointed his ski poles and playfully shouted invectives as their tracks crossed.\\n\\nWesley laughed, and his two friends followed him left and over a small rise.\\n\\nRudolph headed straight down the mountain.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI remember looking back at where he was going and being confused,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Wesley said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cLike, \\xe2\\x80\\x98Where is he going?\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nAll the locals in the group presumed they knew what the others were thinking. They did not.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhen you know an avalanche is not very likely, that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a great way to go,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Wesley said of Rudolph\\xe2\\x80\\x99s choice to ski straight down farther. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s three open glades of awesome powder.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nEarlier that morning, Wesley and Carlson had skied the opposite side of Cowboy Mountain, in the ski area. It had been cleared of avalanches by the ski patrol at dawn, but the two still triggered several slough slides \\xe2\\x80\\x94 small, shallow avalanches that washed at their feet and petered out before snagging victims.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThat\\xe2\\x80\\x99s why, when they said we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re doing Tunnel, I was like, \\xe2\\x80\\x98Ooh, dicey,\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Wesley said.\\n\\nPankey and Carlson followed Wesley and looked back, too, wondering why Rudolph and the others were not following them toward relatively safer terrain. Within a minute, long enough to be well out of sight of the group they left behind, the three men found something that made them stop.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe were right on top of a knoll, a little rollover, where we were about to make some really fun turns, and we saw that the face had already slid,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Carlson said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt was pretty large.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nSigns of Trouble\\n\\nAfter breaking from the larger group, Ron Pankey and two others discover nearby avalanche activity.\\n\\nAlarmed, the three decided to go farther left. They crossed through trees and avoided big meadows and steep pitches. They soon found evidence of another avalanche, this one cutting through the forest.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI\\xe2\\x80\\x99d really never seen anything slide in the trees like that,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Carlson said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnd that was definitely like: \\xe2\\x80\\x98Holy cow, we shouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t be back here, Ron. Let\\xe2\\x80\\x99s go left. Let\\xe2\\x80\\x99s go hard left.\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nWesley had disappeared in the pale light. He left nothing but a track through the deep snow that the others tried to follow.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI just went, and didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t really stop,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Wesley said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI went all the way down. But I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve never taken a run where I looked uphill more times in fear.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98I Got Eyes on You\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\nRudolph stopped on the left edge of the upper meadow, above a cluster of trees. Others filed behind him, spilling down the mountain in plumes of spraying snow.\\n\\nErin Dessert did not follow. She was confused. She was once a Tunnel Creek regular, until a nonfatal avalanche captured five friends in 2002 and scared her away.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cChris Rudolph\\xe2\\x80\\x99s, like, totally all about safety protocol and mountain awareness and wisdom,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThat guy knows the conditions like an animal. He has instincts. It didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t register, even for a second, that he might be bringing this group to Tunnel Creek. It wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t logical. I thought we were doing the front side.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nShe headed hard to the right, away from the others. The other snowboarders that she knew, Carlson and Wesley, were gone in the opposite direction. Some in the remaining group noticed Dessert heading away in the distance and dismissed her as an oblivious backcountry rookie. She dipped out of sight in a lonely panic.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve been riding Stevens Pass since I was 3 years old,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Dessert said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI can tell circumstances, and I just felt like something besides myself was in charge. They\\xe2\\x80\\x99re all so professional and intelligent and driven and powerful and riding with athletic prowess, yet everything in my mind was going off, wanting to tell them to stop.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nRudolph and the others, now a group of 12, were focused downhill. It was 11:52 a.m. Rudolph did not wait for the back of the pack to arrive before continuing to demonstrate the way.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cSo Chris Rudolph went first, and then he pulled into the trees and we waited for a sec,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Castillo, who was near the front of the group, wearing a helmet camera. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHe goes out of sight and behind the trees. So I said, \\xe2\\x80\\x98O.K., Megan, go ahead, spoon those tracks, and you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll see Chris on the left.\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nIt was not Megan Michelson. It was Elyse Saugstad.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI thought it was Megan,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Castillo said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI said, \\xe2\\x80\\x98Are you Megan?\\xe2\\x80\\x99 She said, \\xe2\\x80\\x98No, no, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m Elyse.\\xe2\\x80\\x99 That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s when I met Elyse. It was right there. And she made these turns that were like: \\xe2\\x80\\x98Aah, I think I know who that is. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve seen her name. Those are pro turns.\\xe2\\x80\\x99 She ripped the hell out of it.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nSaugstad traced through the knee-deep snow just to the right of Rudolph\\xe2\\x80\\x99s elongated S-shape tracks. She dipped through trees at a pinch in the meadow and disappeared out of sight. She crossed over Rudolph\\xe2\\x80\\x99s tracks and giggled. After about 30 seconds, she was back at Rudolph\\xe2\\x80\\x99s side, having cut left into a notch of the trees again.\\n\\nSkiing Down\\n\\nElyse Saugstad, second in the group, skis Tunnel Creek.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe skied to an area that was probably about 500 feet down or so from where we started,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Saugstad said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnd where we skied to was an area of old-growth trees. You know, several-hundred-year-old trees. A very good indication that this is a safe place. Things don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t happen here.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nCastillo and Brenan teased each other about who would go next.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cFinally, he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s like, \\xe2\\x80\\x98Go ahead, I got eyes on you,\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Castillo said.\\n\\nFrom where Rudolph and Saugstad stopped, they could not see the subsequent skiers approach. Castillo went past and cut left. His camera recorded Rudolph and Saugstad whooping their approval as he stopped in a shower of powder, about 40 feet below them.\\n\\nBut just before he stopped, Castillo was jolted by a weird sensation.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cA little pang, like, ooh, this is a pretty heavy day out here,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Castillo said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThing\\xe2\\x80\\x99s holding, but I remember having a feeling.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nCastillo stopped above two trees. He nestled close and pushed his right ski tight against them.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cA lot of people think you should be below trees, but I stand above them,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Castillo said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI\\xe2\\x80\\x99m like, \\xe2\\x80\\x98I\\xe2\\x80\\x99d rather get pinned against this than taken through.\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHis helmet camera showed that 14 seconds after Castillo stopped, Brenan appeared through the trees above Rudolph and Saugstad. Brenan had hugged the tree line on the left, avoiding the open meadow, then slalomed through the patch that the others used for protection. He stopped in a spray of snow a few feet from Rudolph and Saugstad.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThat was sick!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d someone shouted.\\n\\nCastillo silently took note of the terrain.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI was downhill from them \\xe2\\x80\\x94 skier\\xe2\\x80\\x99s right from them,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Castillo said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBut the trees that they were behind, I didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t think it was a bad spot to stop. They were huge. Giant old-growths that three of us probably can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t put our hands around.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nBut he knew the direction of the slope did not follow the meadow. It dipped harder left into the trees, down toward a gully. And there were still a lot of skiers above them.\\n\\nSaugstad was next to Rudolph. Brenan was a few feet away.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe weren\\xe2\\x80\\x99t straight across from each other, in a perfect horizontal line on the slope,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Saugstad said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe were peppered up and down, spread out.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nCastillo kept his attention up the hill. Less than 30 seconds after Brenan stopped, he saw Tim Wangen cut through the trees above the earlier arrivals, gliding horizontally through the forest. Wangen had been taught how to navigate Tunnel Creek by his father. He knew that the farther down the mountain he went, the harder it would be to cut over the ridge and into the next big meadow. He crossed the shallow gully and rose up the other side.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI could see the others when I cut over,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Wangen said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI thought: Oh yeah, that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a bad place to be. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a bad place to be with that many people. But I didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t say anything. I didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t want to be the jerk.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nWangen had told Peikert to follow his tracks, and Peikert was close behind. Castillo watched where they went.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWant to cut over?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Castillo shouted to those above him.\\n\\nSliding Snow\\n\\nThe start of an avalanche is unlike any other force of nature.\\n\\nA hurricane is foretold by wind and lashing waves. A tornado often is spotted before it strikes. Lightning is usually presaged by black clouds and rumbling thunder.\\n\\nAvalanches rarely provide such a warning. Unlike waves or wind, tremors or storms, they are usually triggered by their own victims, sometimes unaware of what has been unleashed.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIf you swim out in the ocean, the ocean\\xe2\\x80\\x99s always alive,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Saugstad said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou can feel it. But the mountains feel like they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re asleep.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nBack up the mountain, Jack never seemed worried. That was his nature. Here he was, a rare weekend off, skiing with some of his best friends from Leavenworth and people from Powder and ESPN and all over the industry, on an epic run on a perfect powder day.\\n\\nCarlsen, the Powder photographer, had never been to Tunnel Creek. The first few easy turns gave way to a slope that fell steeply away, out of sight. He sidled up to Jack.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI grabbed him, and I said, \\xe2\\x80\\x98What is the move here?\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Carlsen said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt was basically like, \\xe2\\x80\\x98This is getting real, how do we handle it?\\xe2\\x80\\x99 He\\xe2\\x80\\x99s like: \\xe2\\x80\\x98Oh, no big deal. We go out here, swing out, make a few pow turns, and get back in the trees.\\xe2\\x80\\x99 I looked at him and said, \\xe2\\x80\\x98Have a great run.\\xe2\\x80\\x99 Gave him a fist, a knuckle-to-knuckle high-five thing. And that was it. I watched him swing out, way out, skier\\xe2\\x80\\x99s right, and then dive into his turn left.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nJack flowed through the thick powder with his typical ease. He skied the way other people walked down a sidewalk, a friend had said.\\n\\nJack disappeared over the knoll, gliding through the trees in the middle of the meadow. Behind him, the five remaining skiers watched in silence.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHe looked like he was having a great time, the run of his life, in fact,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Michelson said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnd he actually made, I remember, a little \\xe2\\x80\\x98woo\\xe2\\x80\\x99 sound, as he dropped in on his first or second turn because the snow was really good. It was deep and light.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nThen the snow changed without warning.\\n\\nAcross the meadow, above Jack, loose snow seemed to chase him down the hill and out of sight.\\n\\nNot everyone saw it. A couple did. They caught it in their peripheral vision and were unsure what to make of it.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThat was sketchy,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Hammond said.\\n\\nThe five others listened. Not a sound. They stared for clues through the flat light below a murky sky. Nothing.\\n\\nSilent seconds ticked. Finally, Hammond spotted the first sign of evidence. It came from a tree, one among thousands, far down the hill, almost out of sight. Only the top of it was visible, and it was covered in snow.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI saw it moving,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Hammond said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cLike something had hit the tree, and it shook. And I could see the powder falling off the tree.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nChris Rudolph\\n\\n30, Director of marketing at Stevens Pass\\n\\nElyse Saugstad\\n\\n33, Professional freeskier\\n\\nRob Castillo\\n\\n40, Former competitive skier, longtime friend of Jack and Brenan\\n\\nJohnny Brenan\\n\\n41, Home builder, married father of two\\n\\nTim Wangen\\n\\n53, Lifelong backcountry skier in Stevens Pass area\\n\\nWenzel Peikert\\n\\n29, Part-time ski instructor\\n\\nJim Jack\\n\\n46, Head judge of the Freeskiing World Tour\\n\\nPart Four\\n\\nBlur of White\\n\\nA few hundred yards down the mountain, a ghostly white fog rushed through the forest.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI saw it,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Saugstad said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI saw it coming. But it was weird because it was coming through the trees. It was like snow billowing through the trees. Because it was such a treed area, I think for the first second I saw it I didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t believe it.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nWangen and Peikert had just traversed in front of its path. It did not miss them by much.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know if I\\xe2\\x80\\x99d even come to a stop when I heard it,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Peikert said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt was almost like wind and pressure more than noise. It literally felt like a freight train went over my tails. It wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t a deep rumble. I could feel this rush of air.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nIt was a blur of white, its shattered pieces moving about 50 m.p.h., a powder cloud two stories tall.\\n\\nRudolph was the only one to scream.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAvalanche! Elyse!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Rudolph shouted.\\n\\nSaugstad tried to stride right, hoping to escape. She barely moved before snow flowed through her legs, dragging her down like a riptide.\\n\\nShe pulled the cord on her air bag. She was overwhelmed so quickly by the rising snow that she did not know if it inflated.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI had no ability to control what was happening to me,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Saugstad said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI was being tossed over and over and over. It was like being in a washing machine and all my body parts flailing every way. I didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know which way was up. I didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know which way was down. I couldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t see anything.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nShe is likely to have tumbled just past Castillo. He groaned and turned his face away. He stuck his head between two trees, like a prisoner in a stockade.\\n\\nFor 16 seconds, snow and ice pounded his back and washed over him. His shoulders were jammed against the trees. His face pushed into branches of pine needles. He could feel the heavy assault of snow lashing at his back.\\n\\nTrees cracked around him. Some in the path were chopped in half \\xe2\\x80\\x94 the stumps left in the soil, the rest carried away in the growing torrent.\\n\\nThe avalanche, a relatively small one, started with about 6,000 cubic meters of snow and collected 7,000 cubic meters more on the way down. It probably weighed about 11 million pounds.\\n\\nThe Tunnel Creek Avalanche        In real time\\n\\nBased on a simulation from the Swiss Federal Institute of Snow and Avalanche Research\\n\\nBased on a simulation from the Swiss Federal Institute of Snow and Avalanche Research\\n\\nThe trees Castillo hugged in each arm swayed but held. He told himself that when he felt the flow slow, he would pop a hand in the air so that it might stick out of the snow and make him easier to rescue.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cJust as I had the thought about what I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m going to do, wondering if it was going to bury me, that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s right when I could feel it,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Castillo said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt was like a wave. Like when you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re in the ocean and the tide moves away from you. You\\xe2\\x80\\x99re getting thrashed and you feel it pull out and you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re like, O.K., I can stand up now.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nCastillo saw daylight again. His camera captured snow sliding past his legs for another 13 seconds. The forest sounded as if it were full of sickly frogs. It was the trees, scrubbed of their fresh snow, still swaying and creaking around him.\\n\\nCastillo turned to look back up the hill.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhere there were three people, there was nobody,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Castillo said.\\n\\nA Ticking Clock\\n\\nHe did not know who or what set off the avalanche. He did not know how far down the mountain it went. All he knew was that about a dozen people had been above him a minute earlier, and that the gully below him descended another 2,000 vertical feet to the valley floor.\\n\\nAnd he was alone.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cJohnny! Johnny Brenan!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Castillo screamed into the stillness, his voice escalating with panic. The scope of the disaster was too much to comprehend. He wanted to find his partner.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cSo I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m screaming his name,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Castillo said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI\\xe2\\x80\\x99m screaming and screaming. Silence.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nStreams of snow still flowed downhill as he scooted toward the heart of the slide path. It flowed into a wide gully, maybe 100 feet across, that narrowed as it descended. Castillo turned his beacon to \\xe2\\x80\\x9csearch\\xe2\\x80\\x9d mode, meaning he would receive signals of those buried, but would not emit signals himself.\\n\\nLeft, the avalanche started with a large crack nearly 200 feet across and 3 feet deep that sent millions of pounds of snow down the mountain. (The Stevens Pass Ski Patrol, which investigated the avalanche the next day, drew the fault line on the picture.) Below, the path the avalanche took as it crashed through trees and headed into a gully. Stevens Pass Ski Patrol\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t want to be in this gully because I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know what\\xe2\\x80\\x99s coming down next,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Castillo said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t want to be the next guy taken out. Now I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t even have a beacon on because I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m on search. They\\xe2\\x80\\x99re not going to find me if anything happens to me.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nAcross the gully, unable to see anyone else, either, Peikert and Wangen had gone into search mode, too.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI was like, if there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s someone in that, the clock\\xe2\\x80\\x99s ticking,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Peikert said.\\n\\nChances of survival drop precipitously every minute. According to a recent study, the survival rate for individuals completely buried in an avalanche falls to about 40 percent after 15 minutes of burial and to 25 percent after 30 minutes. About 75 percent of avalanche victims die from asphyxia or suffocation. The other 25 percent of fatalities result from trauma.\\n\\nCastillo spotted Peikert and Wangen across the gully. They, too, were nervous about hangfire, the unstable snow left along the edges of an avalanche\\xe2\\x80\\x99s path that can release at any moment.\\n\\nThe avalanche had turned the gully into an oversize bobsled run, with slick, high-banked walls.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThis gully\\xe2\\x80\\x99s hard-core!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Castillo yelled. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThey\\xe2\\x80\\x99re in it!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nWangen stayed mostly on the banks. Peikert and Castillo crossed the gully a couple of times, reluctantly and quickly.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat\\xe2\\x80\\x99s your name again?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Castillo shouted at Peikert.\\n\\nIt was soon apparent that the victims, however many there were, suffered one of two fates: they were hung up on the banks of the gully, snagged by a tree or buried in snow, or they had been flushed to the bottom, thousands of feet below.\\n\\nIf searchers spent too much time looking along the gully, they might squander a chance at rescuing someone at the bottom. If they rushed downhill, they might pass someone in need of saving.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe started to ski down, hoping to find him in a tree well or hanging on or something,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Castillo, his focus on Brenan. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBut I started to realize all the trees were bent over, and I started thinking, this is really fricking bad. And then I skied down to a point where I found Johnny\\xe2\\x80\\x99s ski, probably three or four feet up in a tree. Stuck.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nCastillo called 911. It was 12:02 p.m. The avalanche occurred seven minutes earlier.\\n\\nRob Castillo 12:02 P.M.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHi, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m at Stevens Pass resort, on the backside of Tunnel Creek,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Castillo told the King County Sheriff\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Department dispatcher. He added, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe had a major avalanche, and we might have three or four people missing, at least.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nThe dispatcher asked him to slow down. Castillo, occasionally shouting at others nearby, tried to explain where the avalanche occurred. He was asked how many people there were.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThere\\xe2\\x80\\x99s at least 10,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Castillo said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBetween 10 and 12.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nThe dispatcher asked if anybody was hurt.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe haven\\xe2\\x80\\x99t found them,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Castillo said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI found one ski. It rolled through pretty heavy, man. I had partners right next to me and they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re missing. I just found a ski about 1,000 yards down. Or 1,000 feet down.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nThe call lasted four minutes. Castillo, carrying his friend\\xe2\\x80\\x99s ski, turned down the mountain.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98This Thing Ripped Big\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\nNear the top, the five skiers who planned to follow Jim Jack deciphered what happened through a series of increasingly blunt clues. Loose snow. A shaking tree.\\n\\nHammond was due to ski next. He took a couple of turns through the fine powder of the meadow and stopped. There was a sudden drop, nearly three feet deep. The fluffy snow was gone. A surface of bluish ice stretched down the hill, into the trees and out of sight.\\n\\nInto Search Mode\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOnce I had gotten to the edge, I was like, oh my gosh, this thing ripped big,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Hammond said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI could see the scope of it.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHe shouted for everyone to go into search mode. The other four skiers moved quickly to see.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe all skied up to it and were like, holy smokes,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Stifter said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cFrom there all I remember was pulling out my phone. And I called Jim Jack.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nOthers started dialing numbers, too. They called Chris Rudolph and Elyse Saugstad. There were no answers. Hammond dropped onto the slick slide path. Another clue lay on the ice, pointing downhill.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI hopped out there and made one or two turns, and I saw one of Jim\\xe2\\x80\\x99s skis,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Hammond said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe only reason I recognized Jim\\xe2\\x80\\x99s skis was that it was a pair of skis that he borrowed from me.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nThe realization that Jack had been carried away was a gut punch.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIn one respect, you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re like, oh no, a ski \\xe2\\x80\\x94 where\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Jim?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Abrams said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cOn the other hand, you think, O.K., there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s his ski. Let\\xe2\\x80\\x99s find him.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nMichelson called 911. According to sheriff\\xe2\\x80\\x99s department records, it was 12:03 p.m.\\n\\nMegan Michelson 12:03 PM\\n\\nHer voice was steady and sure. She patiently tried to explain where they were \\xe2\\x80\\x94 \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe backside of the ski area in the backcountry,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she explained. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cTunnel Creek.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nThe dispatcher asked if people were buried.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI believe so, yes,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Michelson replied. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know how many. We have a large group.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nWord was relayed to the ski area. Chris Brixey, manager of the Stevens Pass Ski Patrol, had 17 patrollers working on the mountain that day, two more in the aid room, and a dispatcher. Brixey is a regular at Johnny Brenan\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Monday night poker parties. He did not know that a group of friends, including Rudolph, his Stevens Pass co-worker, had gone to Tunnel Creek.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI happened to be walking through the aid room,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Brixey said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cOur dispatcher handed me a note that said 10 people are buried in Tunnel Creek. I called the 911 operator and got Megan\\xe2\\x80\\x99s information. I called Megan directly. She said there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s about 12 people and they were looking for eight people. I didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know Megan. My gut feeling was that this was a group of inexperienced people who are now dealing with tragedy.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nBrixey called the area\\xe2\\x80\\x99s most seasoned patroller and put him in charge of the four-member first-response unit, called the hasty team, to follow the group\\xe2\\x80\\x99s trail. He also enlisted other patrollers and a pair of avalanche rescue dogs.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nWord of a large avalanche in Tunnel Creek soon echoed around Stevens Pass, from the patrol room to the R.V. lot, up the lifts and down the slopes. According to the Stevens Pass Ski Patrol log, the area closed public access to the boundary gate atop the Seventh Heaven lift at 12:19.\\n\\nBy then, the group that had started off together less than 30 minutes earlier was strewn up and down nearly 3,000 vertical feet. No one knew how many were missing.\\n\\nKeith Carlsen was nearest the top, searching for Jack.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI thought someone has to make sure he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not still up here,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Carlsen said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t likely, but his ski was there, and he got swept, and there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s no sign of him, so maybe he got pummeled into the snow, into a hole, somewhere, right away.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nThe others headed down, scanning the path and its edges with their beacons. Carlsen methodically checked the upper meadow.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI thought I was going to be the one to find him, and I would find him alone,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Carlsen said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnd the bed surface at the top was rock hard. And I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m thinking: I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m going to get a signal, and this guy\\xe2\\x80\\x99s going to be buried, and I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m going to have to somehow dig him out. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m going to find Jim Jack.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nScared and alone, Carlsen\\xe2\\x80\\x99s voice broke the silence.\\n\\nPhotographs from the Stevens Pass Ski Patrol accident report, taken a day after the Tunnel Creek avalanche, showed its twisting path. After starting in a broad meadow, the avalanche funneled into a narrow ravine. Stevens Pass Ski Patrol\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI\\xe2\\x80\\x99m saying, and I remember repeating this in my head: \\xe2\\x80\\x98Jim, am I about to find you? Jim, are you underneath me? Jim, where the hell are you? Is this possible? Is he really underneath here? Am I about to dig Jim out?\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nFarther down, others followed the path into the gully. As it descends toward the valley floor, it carves deeper into the mountain. In some spots, canyon walls are 20 feet high. There were steep, icy drops that would become gushing waterfalls during the spring runoff.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThere are places it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s so tight that I would stop and my skis would straddle the middle,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Hammond said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnd I\\xe2\\x80\\x99d be elevated, like being on springs.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nIt was still clogged with rocks and trees that had not been fully scoured away. Where the ravine bent, the avalanche rode high on the outside wall, like a child on a water slide, sometimes breaking over the top of the bank and unearthing trees on the ridges.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt was fear,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Abrams said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cFear that you lost someone, and fear that you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re standing in an avalanche path. You\\xe2\\x80\\x99re thinking, Don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t get caught up on trees, listen for the beacons, where\\xe2\\x80\\x99s my fianc\\xc3\\xa9e?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nIt became increasingly evident that whoever was caught in the avalanche would be found at the bottom.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI probably went down for one or two minutes and I got no signal,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Michelson said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI shouted: \\xe2\\x80\\x98They\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve gone all the way down! The way this gully is, they\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve been flushed.\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nPart Five\\n\\nDiscovery\\n\\nTim Carlson and Ron Pankey, having split from the big group at the top, nervously negotiated the roundabout route to the bottom of Tunnel Creek. They could not catch up to Tim Wesley, but followed his snowboard track to the valley floor. It was 12:07 p.m.\\n\\nThey glided past the foot of a mound of chunky debris. One of the ravines had spewed a sizable avalanche, but there was no way to know it had occurred in the past few minutes.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI looked up and I saw a ski pole sticking up,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Carlson said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt looked like someone stuck it in there. It was sticking up right at the very end of the pile. Handle up.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHe shouted to Pankey.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI was like, \\xe2\\x80\\x98Dude, you need to turn your transceiver on,\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Carlson said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9c\\xe2\\x80\\x98There\\xe2\\x80\\x99s people in here.\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98Is that a ski pole?\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\nJust after the avalanche, Ron Pankey and Tim Carlson discover the debris pile.\\n\\nCarlson clicked out of his snowboard bindings and climbed onto the pile. Pankey turned his beacon to search mode. It beeped immediately.\\n\\nHis skis off, Pankey climbed onto the debris pile, too. He saw the ski pole and two gloves. He was sucker-punched by dread.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou figure someone who is fighting is going to have his gloves on,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Pankey said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIf they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re limp, yeah, their gloves are going to come off.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nThen he noticed the brand.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThat was my thought \\xe2\\x80\\x94 Oh, God, those are Scott gloves. Jim Jack was wearing Scott gloves,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Pankey said.\\n\\nTheir beacons shrieked.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI probably searched for maybe a minute before I was on top of a signal,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Carlson said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYour signal goes \\xe2\\x80\\x98beepbeepbeepbeepbeep - BEEPBEEPBEEPBEEPBEEP,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 and it gets a little fainter, like oh, over here. I got a strong signal, traversed over, got a weak signal, went back, got a strong signal, went back and I was basically on top of a body.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnd, uh, the first shovel I dug in, I hit Jim Jack\\xe2\\x80\\x99s arm.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nThe two men dug frantically.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI saw Jim Jack\\xe2\\x80\\x99s face,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Carlson said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cEyes open, just staring at me. We could see he wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t breathing. Ron started giving him breaths and I was searching for his body, underneath his chest. I was like, \\xe2\\x80\\x98What the hell is going on?\\xe2\\x80\\x99 There was no body where you\\xe2\\x80\\x99d expect a body to be. And then I started digging around, and I could see he was folded up into this ball. His feet were above his head.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHis body had been pummeled.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThere was no blood, but he didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have his helmet on, he didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have his backpack on, his jacket was pulled over his head,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Carlson said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHe had some scrapes on his belly. And just pulling him out of the snow you could feel it and see it. Giving him a couple of breaths, it just came out so quick. And you push on his chest and it would just collapse. There was nothing there. And Jim Jack \\xe2\\x80\\x94 we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re all strong dudes, and there was just nothing left.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI pulled his arm upright, and it was just really soft,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Carlson added. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt was like pulling a wet towel. Pulled the other arm and it was the same feeling. And I pulled his legs out, and there was nothing connected to anything. It was completely crushed.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nThey turned off Jack\\xe2\\x80\\x99s beacon and tried to lay him peacefully in the snow. Pankey pushed his eyelids closed.\\n\\nRon Pankey 12:31 PM\\n\\nHe called 911 at 12:31 p.m. and told the dispatcher that he had \\xe2\\x80\\x9crecovered a body.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nShe asked him for his name.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cJim Jack,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Pankey replied.\\n\\nJack\\xe2\\x80\\x99s phone chirped. It had survived the avalanche, and Pankey reached into Jack\\xe2\\x80\\x99s pocket and pulled it out. It was a text message from Jack\\xe2\\x80\\x99s girlfriend, Tiffany Abraham. Rumors of a big avalanche in Tunnel Creek had reached the base area of Stevens Pass.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhere are you?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d it read. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou OK?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nPankey looked over at the ski pole sticking straight out of the snow. It looked familiar. Pankey had noticed it on the hike up the ridge to Cowboy Mountain.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThat\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the guy\\xe2\\x80\\x99s in front of me,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Pankey said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHe was hiking in front of me and Jim Jack was behind me, and he had these old Smith, corrective angle, curved poles. So I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m like, \\xe2\\x80\\x98That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Johnny\\xe2\\x80\\x99s pole.\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98It Was Just a Bad Dream\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\nAt the upper end of the meadow, more than 100 yards away and out of sight, Elyse Saugstad waited in the silence, unable to move.\\n\\nShe did not know how long she had been frozen there \\xe2\\x80\\x94 head pointed downhill, hands sticking out of the snow, face poking through the ice just enough to breathe and see the breaking clouds trailing the weekend\\xe2\\x80\\x99s storm.\\n\\nHer hip ached. Her mind wandered. She wondered who else was caught in the avalanche. She wondered who was left to rescue them.\\n\\nShe felt herself getting colder. Her pink mittens, like those of a child\\xe2\\x80\\x99s, had strings that attached them to her jacket. When she had come to a stop, one of the mittens was on her hand. The other was off, hanging from her wrist.\\n\\nSaugstad could not claw the hard-packed snow with her mittens on. She took them off and picked at the ice until her fingers ached. She put her mittens on again until they warmed up.\\n\\nShe had not spoken since the avalanche stopped. It had not occurred to her to cry for help. Someone would come. She hoped.\\n\\nFinally, for the first time, she shouted.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHelp!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she screamed.\\n\\nThe face of Wenzel Peikert startled her.\\n\\nAmong those who skied down the gully, Peikert arrived first to the avalanche\\xe2\\x80\\x99s final resting place. The walls of the ravine slowly fell away and opened onto a wide, sloping meadow. It was covered by an enormous pile of chunky ice cubes, some fit for a cocktail glass, others the size of couches. The debris was filled with dirt, rocks and shredded tree parts.\\n\\nIt stretched about 150 yards down what remained of the slope. It was 10 or 20 feet tall, obstructing Peikert\\xe2\\x80\\x99s view to the bottom. Peikert\\xe2\\x80\\x99s beacon began its frantic chirping.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI started getting a signal,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Peikert said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI marked it with one of my poles. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s what they teach, to mark where you start picking up a signal and keep working to where it gets stronger. I took my skis off because it was so hard to ski on that stuff. And as I got close to that signal, I saw two pink gloves sticking out.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nSaugstad was about 20 feet downhill.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHer feet were into the snow and her head was downhill, but I saw two pink gloves and her face,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Peikert said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know if she uncovered her face or not, but it was just barely sticking out of the snow. And a little bit of orange from her backpack. I started digging her out, trying not to hurt her. I said, \\xe2\\x80\\x98Are you O.K.?\\xe2\\x80\\x99 And she said: \\xe2\\x80\\x98I think so. My leg\\xe2\\x80\\x99s kind of hurt.\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nPeikert pulled his shovel from his backpack and started to dig.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cFor a pause, really quickly, I thought to myself: she\\xe2\\x80\\x99s alive, she\\xe2\\x80\\x99s breathing, her face is out of the snow,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Peikert said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI thought, let\\xe2\\x80\\x99s go find others. But then I realized that more snow could come down. I found someone alive, and I needed to get her out of here.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nSaugstad sensed his urgency.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhen he started unburying me, he flung his shovel and it went flying down the hill so far that he couldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t stop and go get it,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnd so then he had to start digging me out with his hands.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nPeikert hurried, knowing that others were likely buried nearby.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cShe was actually really hard to get out,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cOne of her skis had stayed on, so it had kind of locked her into the snow. Even a ski boot gets locked in. I dug to get her ski off. It probably took five minutes of digging to get her out.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nFinally, Michelson and Abrams arrived from above. They found Peikert and Saugstad on their feet.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t dawn on me that she had been buried,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Michelson said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI was relieved she was alive.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nOver several minutes, others trickled down from above.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOnce we got to the bottom, when we got through the ravine and got to the mouth, I just remember saying, \\xe2\\x80\\x98Oh, my God,\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Stifter said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cSnow chunks the size of boulders. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s when I realized the magnitude of everything. It looked like a war zone. It was chaos.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nMichelson took charge as an impromptu site commander. No one was sure who was missing or how many victims there might be. Michelson used her beacon and pinpointed two spots for others to search, then continued sweeping the meadow to search for more.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cMy numbers and directions were bouncing all over the place,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Peikert said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBut Megan comes up and hers was right on it. Mine is a little bit older, but I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know why it was bouncing around. I started probing, and I hit a spot where there obviously was something other than snow.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nPeikert and Rob Castillo dug through the ice. It had been more than 30 minutes since the avalanche.\\n\\nFinding Their Friends\\n\\nJohnny Brenan was discovered about three feet below the surface. He had been buried a few feet from Saugstad all along.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI found his back first,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Peikert said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHis head was really bent under. I tried to dig a hole through his armpit, to his head, thinking I might be able to get his face turned to give him C.P.R. There was blood. His chin was split open. His helmet was pushed back onto the back of his head and was filled with snow. One leg was off in a weird position, like he had a broken femur or hip or something. I finally got him out. He was cold. Blue.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nCastillo, Brenan\\xe2\\x80\\x99s longtime friend and ski partner, worked side by side with Peikert, at last getting his legs out.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe muscles were just beat,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Castillo said.\\n\\nAbout 20 feet up the hill, Abrams, Wangen and Stifter zeroed in on a victim, too. It was the spot that Peikert had marked with his pole before he spotted Saugstad.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe were still searching for the lowest signal,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Stifter said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnd the lowest signal I got on the transceiver was 2.4, and it took me, like, half a second to realize, oh, that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s six feet down because it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s in meters. So I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m like, all right, this is our lowest reading. And I think on our third probe we struck something. I told Dan and Tim, \\xe2\\x80\\x98All right, get the shovels out,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 and we started digging.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nDigging was nothing like scooping snow from a driveway. It was more like shoveling the chunky piles that snowplows leave along the side of a cleared highway, full of large pieces seemingly glued together.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThey\\xe2\\x80\\x99re big mounds of snow and they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re like concrete,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Stifter said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cSo you dig and dig, and then that person would rotate to the back and take a break and the guy who was second would start clearing snow out for the guy who is digging.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nQuickly exhausted, they rotated frequently.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt was just a bad dream,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Abrams said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI was standing there holding my shovel that I never intended to use, except maybe to get my car out.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nFinally, they reached a victim: Chris Rudolph.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHe was lying facedown, so it was hard to get to his face,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Stifter said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnd it was hard because we couldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t move him because he was just encased in there. His feet were buried really deeply. Finally I was able to get to his face. His face was blue. And so finally I was like: \\xe2\\x80\\x98We\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve got to get his feet out! We\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve got to get his feet out!\\xe2\\x80\\x99 That took another good couple of minutes to get his feet free. Then we gently pulled him out by his backpack.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nStifter performed C.P.R. on Rudolph: 2 breaths, 30 compressions, to the point of exhaustion.\\n\\nSaugstad called 911. It was 12:40 p.m.\\n\\nElyse Saugstad 12:40 PM\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI\\xe2\\x80\\x99m reporting an avalanche,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she said, breathlessly.\\n\\nFrantic voices behind her shouted encouragement.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cCome on! You can do it! Come on, buddy! Take a breath!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nThe dispatcher said there were \\xe2\\x80\\x9cunits on scene.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Saugstad said they had not arrived and asked if they were coming by helicopter.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cUh, we do not have a helicopter yet in the area because of the avalanche risk,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d the dispatcher said.\\n\\nHammond was the last to arrive from above and took over trying to revive Rudolph.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI definitely believed that there was a chance,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Stifter said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMy hope dissipated certainly after Joel got there and I was sitting there. We knew. We looked at each other.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nTwenty feet downhill, the huddle around Brenan slowly came to the same conclusion. Peikert had been performing C.P.R. for close to 30 minutes, with Castillo\\xe2\\x80\\x99s help.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI was hoping for a miracle then,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Castillo said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBut I really kind of understood that he was probably dead.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nAn hour\\xe2\\x80\\x99s worth of adrenaline dissolved to disheartened shock. A few other skiers had happened upon the scene, but no rescue help had arrived.\\n\\nSaugstad walked around dazed, wearing her deflated air bag \\xe2\\x80\\x9clike dead angel wings,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Carlsen said. Castillo made his way to the bottom of the hill to learn that Jim Jack was dead, too. Erin Dessert, the snowboarder who had veered away from the group at the top, frightened by the direction everyone was headed, had cautiously made her way down and rediscovered the group. She cradled Rudolph\\xe2\\x80\\x99s head as others tried their last attempts to resuscitate him.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Chris Rudolph,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou know? He\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the knight in shining armor of Stevens Pass.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nPart Six\\n\\nWord Spreads\\n\\nLaurie Brenan and Tiffany Abraham, Jack\\xe2\\x80\\x99s girlfriend, were both in the Bull\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Tooth Pub and Eatery, on the second level of the Granite Peaks Lodge.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI saw Tiffany sitting at the bar, and I sat a few seats away,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Brenan said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cShe says, \\xe2\\x80\\x98I haven\\xe2\\x80\\x99t seen Jim yet.\\xe2\\x80\\x99 And I said, \\xe2\\x80\\x98Oh, he and Johnny did Tunnel Creek.\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nThe man next to Abraham, a neighbor from Leavenworth, overheard. There was an avalanche in Tunnel Creek, he said. Someone came into the restaurant a while ago and asked for volunteers to help search.\\n\\nAbraham\\xe2\\x80\\x99s heart sank. Normally a font of buoyant optimism, she had a sudden pang of dread.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI downed my cocktail because I knew I\\xe2\\x80\\x99d need it,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Abraham said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe bartender was telling a story, and I was trying to be polite and listen, but I knew I had to get out of there. I got my lunch boxed up and walked down to the ski patrol office. I took the elevator, and it was the slowest elevator in the world.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nShe could tell immediately that bad news was waiting. She spotted a friend who was on his way to the scene.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHe grabs my hand and I screamed at him,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Abraham said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9c\\xe2\\x80\\x98What the hell is going on?\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nAnne Hessburg at the house she shared with Chris Rudolph in Leavenworth, Wash. Ruth Fremson/The New York Times\\n\\nTiffany Abraham at the house she shared with Jim Jack in Leavenworth, Wash. Jack\\xe2\\x80\\x99s camper is in the background. Ruth Fremson/The New York Times\\n\\nLaurie Brenan at home in Peshastin, Wash., with Huckleberry, left, and Pablo. Ruth Fremson/The New York Times\\n\\nThey went into the ski patrol room, on the ground level on the backside of the lodge. Inside is a first-aid room with beds for injured skiers. Beyond is a ski patrol break room, a couch against one wall.\\n\\nAnne Hessburg, Rudolph\\xe2\\x80\\x99s girlfriend, was sitting there, balled up in tears. She had skied all morning with a friend and taken an early lunch at the Iron Goat pizzeria. She walked up to the slope-side cabin that Rudolph had provided to the journalists from Powder magazine. Hessburg stored skis there. A friend received a call while she was there.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cSomeone told him there was an avalanche in Tunnel Creek,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Hessburg said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHe told me, and my stomach immediately dropped.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHessburg rushed to the ski patrol room. She could tell by the way people were moving that it was something serious. She could hear the squawks on the walkie-talkies. Someone told her only that Rudolph was probably involved, as if to break the emotional fall.\\n\\nBrixey, the ski patrol manager, confirmed it. Rudolph was dead. That was about when Abraham walked into the patrol room with her friend, noticing a broken Hessburg on the couch.\\n\\nAbraham\\xe2\\x80\\x99s friend turned to her, looked her in the eyes, and told her about Jack.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cBaby girl, he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s gone,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI just lost my breath,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Abraham said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI lost it. I couldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t even be in my skin.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nLaurie Brenan had no premonition. She watched Abraham rush out of the restaurant at the news of an avalanche and casually followed a few minutes behind.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI thought everything was fine,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBut I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m going over to ski patrol. I felt like Johnny was probably using his skills, digging somebody out.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nShe tried to stay out of the way as people hurried in and out of the patrol room.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThen I heard someone say something about Jim Jack, and I thought, oh my God, how can that be?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Brenan said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI knew they were all in the same group. I start calling to see if I can get someone to get my kids safe, back to the R.V., and get them a snack and put on a movie or something.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nBrenan spotted Brixey, the patrol manager and Monday night poker player, and waited for an opening to approach.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI said, \\xe2\\x80\\x98So, Chris, there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s been an avalanche in Tunnel Creek?\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Brenan said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnd he said yes. Anyone hurt? He said yes. Is anyone dead? He said yes. And I said, \\xe2\\x80\\x98Do I know these people?\\xe2\\x80\\x99 And he said yes. I said, \\xe2\\x80\\x98Where\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Johnny?\\xe2\\x80\\x99 And he said, \\xe2\\x80\\x98I haven\\xe2\\x80\\x99t heard.\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nDispatcher to Ski Patrol 1:01 PM\\n\\nIt was true. One 911 call from Tunnel Creek had reported the death of Jack. Another had reported the death of Rudolph. A third made mention of a third fatality, but the dispatcher never asked the name. Brixey did not learn about Brenan until his own patrol members reached the scene.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI went outside, totally shaking,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Laurie Brenan said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI kept dropping my water bottle, again and again, because I was shaking so much. Then Chris Brixey comes and gets me.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nBrixey\\xe2\\x80\\x99s outward calm belied the turmoil inside. As a paramedic, he had told a lot of strangers that a loved one had died. But never a close friend.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThat was, by far, the biggest challenge for me, walking Laurie from outside back to my office,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Brixey said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cNot knowing what I was going to say, but knowing what I had to say.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nThey walked past the empty beds, past Hessburg on the couch, past Abraham. In the office, he turned to her.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHe said Johnny was one of the people buried,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Brenan said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9c\\xe2\\x80\\x98He didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t make it.\\xe2\\x80\\x99 I didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t want to believe it. I said, \\xe2\\x80\\x98Have you seen him?\\xe2\\x80\\x99 He said no. I said: \\xe2\\x80\\x98Then you don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s possible he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not there. You go back and get more information because that is wrong. Go. Go find him. You\\xe2\\x80\\x99re wrong.\\xe2\\x80\\x99 I remember thinking: He\\xe2\\x80\\x99s got two kids. This was for fun. Johnny doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t leave his responsibilities. Ever.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nThe Hardest Thing\\n\\nBrixey left. Brenan melted into shock. Finally, a friend from Leavenworth came in. He had gone to Tunnel Creek about 20 minutes behind the large group and happened upon the scene.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHe said, \\xe2\\x80\\x98I can tell you it was him,\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Laurie Brenan said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9c\\xe2\\x80\\x98I gave him C.P.R. We tried.\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt really felt like I had died then,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Brenan said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnd that I was reborn into a nightmare.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nA Grim Vigil\\n\\nBack on the other side of Cowboy Mountain, and down a meadow that had been turned inside out, weary huddles surrounded three dead men.\\n\\nHope had surrendered. Rescues became grim vigils. The survivors did not know what to do other than wait. The bodies and faces of the victims were covered in jackets because it seemed the respectful thing to do. Survivors introduced themselves to those they had not met.\\n\\nA group of 16 skiers and snowboarders, all of them experts, all of them unable to refuse the temptation of an hourlong excursion into steep powder, had been reduced by three lives.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI\\xe2\\x80\\x99m so done with it,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Stifter thought to himself. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI\\xe2\\x80\\x99m so done with skiing.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nThe first ski patrollers, along with an avalanche dog named Cava, arrived at 1:05 p.m., 70 minutes after the mountain gave way. They had started at the top and combed the entire path, following the funnel from the wide upper meadow through the flumelike ravine, searching for victims along the way. By the time they spit out of the mouth at the bottom, there was no rescue to be done.\\n\\nThe patrollers recognized faces in the huddles. They realized then that they had been searching for friends, not strangers. They stopped to find Rudolph and Brenan. Another patroller headed farther down to learn about Jack.\\n\\nMore patrollers began to arrive from below, on snowmobiles brought from the highway. A scene of quiet contemplation buzzed with activity and a second wave of despair.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt just became this sea, getting merged into everybody else\\xe2\\x80\\x99s shock,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Dessert said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhen it was just us out there working on them, it seemed beautiful and spiritual, almost like an Indian burial ground.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nRescuers left their gear downhill as they prepared to take victims from the debris field to an awaiting Sno-Cat. The bodies were then transported about a half-mile to the highway. Washington State Department of Transportation\\n\\nThe patrollers tried to revive the victims. It was useless.\\n\\nA medical examiner determined that Jack\\xe2\\x80\\x99s cause of death was \\xe2\\x80\\x9csubdural and subarachnoid hemorrhage\\xe2\\x80\\x9d \\xe2\\x80\\x94 brain trauma. She also diagnosed a partially torn aorta; a broken neck, vertebrae, sternum and ribs; and lacerations of the liver, spleen and pancreas. She described \\xe2\\x80\\x9cblunt force injury of the head, neck, torso and extremities.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nRudolph, with a \\xe2\\x80\\x9cblunt force injury of the torso,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d sustained \\xe2\\x80\\x9crib fractures with right hemothorax and probably compressional asphyxia.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Brenan had \\xe2\\x80\\x9cblunt force injury and compression of the trunk,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d with \\xe2\\x80\\x9cmultiple rib and vertebral fractures with probable compressional asphyxia.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nThey were probably dead by the time the avalanche stopped, or shortly after.\\n\\nBrixey, working by radio over the mountain at Stevens Pass, told all rescue units to stand down. A second surge of patrollers would assist in taking the bodies off the mountain.\\n\\nThe survivors were encouraged to make their way to the highway, where ambulances awaited. Saugstad, missing a ski, used the one of Jack\\xe2\\x80\\x99s that had been found. Hammond had been carrying it on his back.\\n\\nStifter and Carlsen sat on the meadow, unable to pull themselves away.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cEverybody kind of skied down,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Stifter said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt seemed weird to me to leave the bodies.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nAs with other survivors, the quarrel with their own guilt began immediately, the first sign that avalanches swallow more lives than just the ones buried beneath the snow.\\n\\nThey wondered if their mere presence at Stevens Pass that weekend gave rise to the Tunnel Creek trip, a group of proud locals eager to show off for influential out-of-towners. They wondered why they recognized all of the danger signs, starting with the avalanche report that morning over coffee, but did not do enough to slow or stop the expedition. They wondered if they could have saved lives after the avalanche by speeding to the bottom rather than combing the path.\\n\\nThey wondered how so many smart, experienced people could make the types of decisions that turned complex, rich, enviable lives into a growing stack of statistics.\\n\\nActivity disturbed the quiet again. A Sno-Cat, a large machine with treads to climb through snow-covered terrain, rumbled through the trees below and parked at the bottom of the debris pile. Ski patrollers solemnly marched up the hill, carrying gear to wrap the bodies.\\n\\nIt was one deadly avalanche accident among many, perhaps no more worthy of attention than any other. It was not the nation\\xe2\\x80\\x99s deadliest avalanche of the season. And it was not at all like the one that killed 96 people near Tunnel Creek more than a century ago.\\n\\nBut some rituals do not change. The accidents end with an unrefined ceremony.\\n\\nSome patrollers stopped at Jack and wrapped him in a crude bundle using red blankets and rope. Others hiked to where Stifter and Carlsen sat. They wrapped the bodies of Brenan and Rudolph, with quiet expediency and reverence.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI remember they said, \\xe2\\x80\\x98There\\xe2\\x80\\x99s no easy way to do this,\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Stifter said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnd they started slowly dragging them down the hill.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nWatch the Documentary\\n\\nAvalanche at Tunnel Creek\\n\\nThe story in the words of the survivors.\\n\\nGraphics and design by Hannah Fairfield, Xaqu\\xc3\\xadn G.V., Jon Huang, Wayne Kamidoi, Sam Manchester, Alan McLean, Jacky Myint, Graham Roberts, Joe Ward, Jeremy White and Josh Williams.

It involved interviews with every survivor, the families of the deceased, first responders at Tunnel Creek, officials at Stevens Pass and snow-science experts. It also included the examination of reports by the police, the medical examiner and the Stevens Pass Ski Patrol, as well as 40 calls to 911 made in the aftermath of the avalanche. The Swiss Federal Institute for Snow and Avalanche Research provided a computer-generated simulation of the avalanche, based on data accumulated from the Stevens Pass accident report and witness accounts.
